# Roadmap / port status

This documents the gap between this JS port and the original Python engine
(`StatGameDev/Open_PS_Calc`), file by file, so future work can pick up
without re-auditing everything from scratch.

## Fully ported (1:1 structural translation, verified against source)

| Original (Python) | Port (JS) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `core/models/*.py` | `engine/models.js` | dataclasses → factory functions |
| `core/data_loader.py` | `engine/dataLoader.js` | item/mob/skill/table lookups, PS layering |
| `core/bonus_definitions.py` | `engine/bonusDefinitions.js` | bonus-type description/routing tables |
| `core/item_script_parser.py` | `engine/itemScriptParser.js` | incl. a hand-written safe-expression evaluator replacing Python's `ast` module |
| `core/gear_bonus_aggregator.py` | `engine/gearBonusAggregator.js` | |
| `core/build_applicator.py` | `engine/buildApplicator.js` | |
| `core/build_manager.py` | `engine/buildManager.js` | save/load schema, weapon resolution, player→target conversion |

| `core/config.py` | `engine/config.js` | |
| `core/calculators/status_calculator.py` | `engine/calculators/statusCalculator.js` | full 839-line formula set, all SC/song/passive branches |

| `pmf/operations.py` | `engine/pmf.js` | |
| `core/calculators/modifiers/base_damage.py` | `.../modifiers/baseDamage.js` | |
| `.../refine_fix.py` | `.../refineFix.js` | |
| `.../attr_fix.py` | `.../attrFix.js` | |
| `.../forge_bonus.py` | `.../forgeBonus.js` | |

| `.../crit_chance.py` | `.../critChance.js` | |
| `.../crit_atk_rate.py` | `.../critAtkRate.js` | |
| `.../active_status_bonus.py` | `.../activeStatusBonus.js` | complex_flat (SC_ENCHANTBLADE) / rate_chance (SC_GIANTGROWTH) intentionally unported in the original too |
| `.../mastery_fix.py` | `.../masteryFix.js` | |
| `.../defense_fix.py` | `.../defenseFix.js` | incl. `calculate_magic` |
| `.../card_fix.py` | `.../cardFix.js` | incl. incoming-physical/magic variants, not yet wired into a pipeline (see below) |
| `core/calculators/magic_pipeline.py` | `battlePipeline.js#_runMagicBranch` | BF_MAGIC skills now return real damage (MATK roll → skill ratio → MDEF → AttrFix → CardFixMagic). `BF_MAGIC_RATIOS` only has ~30 explicit skills transcribed; others fall back to `skills.json`'s `ratio_per_level`, same as the weapon-skill path. |
| `core/calculators/grand_cross_pipeline.py` | `battlePipeline.js#_runGrandCrossBranch` | `(ATK+MATK) * (100+40*lv)/100 * holy_element_mult`, confirmed verbatim against [wiki.payonstories.com/Grand_Cross](https://wiki.payonstories.com/Grand_Cross) (also matches two independent vanilla pre-renewal community sources, and this repo's own `skills.json` `damage_type: ["IgnoreCards","IgnoreFlee"]`). **Applies the target's defense — asymmetrically**: the physical part takes hard+soft DEF, but the magic part takes **soft MDEF only (NOT hard MDEF)**. Calibrated against in-game screenshots (INT-based GC vs Knight of Abyss, hard MDEF 50, hard DEF 55): observed ~14.2k base / ~17.7k with Provoke Lv10. Full hard-DEF+hard-MDEF undershot badly (~8.4k); ignore-all-hard overshot (~17k); hard-DEF-physical + soft-only-MDEF fits (~15.1k base, ~17.8k Provoke — the Provoke case near-exact). This matches the PDF-verified "with-DEF" audit and PS players' report that a Provoke DEF cut scales GC. A brief full-ignore-DEF experiment (from a terse reading of the wiki formula that omits the assumed DEF step) was reverted. **PS deviation implemented**: the PS wiki states weapon masteries + Demon Bane's flat bonus *do* apply (only their percentage components are excluded) — gated behind a new `PS_GRANDCROSS_MASTERY_APPLIES` mechanic flag in `serverProfiles.js` so vanilla `standard` keeps `masteryFix.js`'s `MASTERY_EXEMPT_SKILLS` bypass. Original Hercules `battle.c` BF_MISC case still not directly inspected (repeated fetches were truncated before reaching it) — not needed now that the PS wiki corroborates the constant directly, but worth re-deriving if precision on the vanilla side matters later. |

## Partially ported

- **`core/server_profiles.py` → `engine/serverProfiles.js`** — `STANDARD`
  (vanilla) is complete. For `PAYON_STORIES`, the following were pulled
  directly from `core/server_profiles.py` on
  [StatGameDev/Open_PS_Calc](https://github.com/StatGameDev/Open_PS_Calc)
  (MIT licensed, fetched in sections to work around source-file size) and
  are now wired in and tested against vanilla to confirm divergence:
  `weapon_ratios` (36 skills, was 0), `weapon_vanilla_ok` (24 skills — used
  to suppress `skillRatio.js`'s "PS unaudited" warning for confirmed-vanilla
  skills), `magic_ratios` (10 skills, was 0), `magic_vanilla_ok` (20 skills
  — same warning-suppression, newly added to `_runMagicBranch` for parity
  with the weapon path), and 4 more `mechanic_flags`
  (`BS_OVERTHRUST_PARTY_FULL_BONUS`, `CR_SHIELDBOOMERANG_NK_IGNORE_FLEE`,
  `CR_SHIELDCHARGE_NK_IGNORE_FLEE`, `RG_BACKSTAP_NK_IGNORE_FLEE`) that
  already had a consumer in this port but weren't turned on. Also fixed:
  `_runMagicBranch`'s PS/vanilla ratio function calls only ever passed
  `skill.level`, never `target`/`ctx` — several PS magic ratios need them
  (e.g. `PR_MAGNUS` checks target race, `WZ_FIREPILLAR` reads
  `skill_params`). Now matches the weapon path's `(lv, tgt, ctx)` signature.
  **PS Assassin/Thief rework flags added and implemented**: three new
  `mechanic_flags` added to the `PAYON_STORIES` profile with full pipeline
  consumers: `AS_KATAR_SECOND_HIT` (katar second-hit proc),
  `TF_POISON_USES_WEAPON_ELEMENT` (Envenom attack element follows weapon
  element), `AS_ENCHANTPOISON_PASSIVE_BONUS` (Enchant Poison skill level
  adds 2% damage per level vs Poison-element targets). `AS_ENCHANTPOISON`
  also added to `dataLoader.js`'s `DAMAGE_RELEVANT` and
  `ACTIVE_SKILL_TYPE_EXCEPTIONS` so the skill appears in the passive panel.
  **PS class reworks added** (see "Done this pass"):
  `SM_MAGNUM_ENDOW_ATTACK_ONLY` (Crusader), `RG_BACKSTAP_OPPORTUNITY` and
  `RG_BOW_DOUBLE_ATTACK` (Rogue). Knight rework uses no new mechanic flags —
  implemented via `SC_TWOHANDQUICKEN.cri_per_lv`, `skill_level_cap_overrides`,
  and `mastery_prefer_fallback`.
  **PS Wizard / High Wizard rework implemented**: `WZ_FROSTNOVA` formula
  corrected to `(175+15×lv) + 10×FrostDiverLv`% (was `50×lv + …`). `WZ_VERMILION`
  added to `PS_BF_MAGIC_RATIOS` with `200×lv`% total (4 waves summed).
  `HW_NAPALMVULCAN` removed from `PS_MAGIC_VANILLA_OK`; element overridden to
  Shadow (Dark=7) via `skill_elements`; 50% MDEF ignore added via
  `HW_NAPALMVULCAN_MDEF_IGNORE` flag. `WZ_FIREPILLAR_MDEF_IGNORE` flag wired
  into `battlePipeline.js`'s `_runMagicBranch`. `SC_AMPLIFYMAGICPOWER` added to
  `statusCalculator.js` with PS-scaling (`min(lv,5)×10`%) gated by
  `SC_AMPLIFYMAGICPOWER_SCALING` flag; vanilla keeps flat 50%. `HW_SOULDRAIN`
  passive +1% MaxHP/lv added to `statusCalculator.js` and exposed as a skill
  slider via `DAMAGE_RELEVANT` / `ACTIVE_SKILL_TYPE_EXCEPTIONS`. Level caps
  added: `WZ_FROSTNOVA:5`, `WZ_FIREPILLAR:5`, `WZ_SIGHTRASHER:5`,
  `WZ_AMPLIFYMAGICPOWER:5`.
  **Still missing**: upstream has a few more `mechanic_flags` with no consumer
  anywhere in this JS port yet (`SC_CLOAKING_BONUS`,
  `GS_BLOCK_ENDOW`,
  `PR_TURNUNDEAD_PS_BONUS`, `PS_HOLYSTRIKE_PROC`,
  `SC_GS_ADJUSTMENT_LR_REDUCE`) — these need new
  modifier code, not just data. (The Musical Strike / Throw Arrow "performing"
  +100% bonus is now implemented via `skill_params.PS_PERFORMING_active` and a
  target-panel toggle, so its two upstream flags are dropped from this list.)
  (`MG_SOULSTRIKE_MDEF_IGNORE`,
  `WZ_FIREPILLAR_MDEF_IGNORE`, `HW_NAPALMVULCAN_MDEF_IGNORE`, and
  `RG_BACKSTAP_OPPORTUNITY` were previously listed here but are now
  implemented — see battle pipeline and "Done this pass" below.)
  Also: 3 of the 36 weapon ratios (`PS_RG_TRICKARROW`, `PS_RG_QUICKSTEP`,
  `PS_PR_HOLYSTRIKE`) are PS-custom skills (`ps_custom_constants.json` IDs
  2631/2633/2622, defined in `ps_skill_db.json`) that **`dataLoader.getSkill()`
  can't resolve at all** — it only ever reads vanilla `db/skills.json`
  regardless of profile, so these 3 skills can't currently be
  selected/calculated by this engine no matter what data exists for them.
  Real architecture gap, not just a data gap — needs `getSkill()` (and skill
  search) to consult `ps_skill_db.json` + `ps_custom_constants.json` when
  `use_ps_data` is set. The ratio data is ready for whenever that's fixed.

- **`core/calculators/modifiers/skill_ratio.py` → `.../modifiers/skillRatio.js`**
  — dispatch/precedence logic complete. `BF_WEAPON_RATIOS` is now the full
  52-entry table from upstream's `_BF_WEAPON_RATIOS` (was ~29) — added the
  23 missing entries (AM_ACIDTERROR, HT_FREEZINGTRAP, KN_AUTOCOUNTER,
  MO_FINGEROFFENSIVE, MO_INVESTIGATE, TK_STORMKICK/DOWNKICK/TURNKICK/COUNTER,
  all 10 GS_* skills, NJ_HUUMA/KASUMIKIRI/KIRIKAGE/KUNAI), verified count
  matches upstream exactly, spot-checked `GS_BULLSEYE`'s conditional
  Brute/Demi-Human race bonus against both a matching and non-matching
  target. The original's `RG_BACKSTAP` weapon-type split and
  parameter-dependent skills (`KN_CHARGEATK`, `MC_CARTREVOLUTION`,
  `TK_JUMPKICK`, `NJ_ZENYNAGE`) are still not transcribed — those need
  per-call context plumbing beyond a flat lookup table, separate piece of
  work. Anything not in either table still falls back to `skills.json`'s
  `ratio_per_level`/`ratio_base`.

- **`core/calculators/battle_pipeline.py` → `.../calculators/battlePipeline.js`**
  — covers normal attacks and BF_WEAPON skills end-to-end (the single most
  important path). **`TF_DOUBLE` (Double Attack) proc now implemented**
  (battle.c:4926 — dagger-only, normal attacks only, mutually exclusive
  with crit; proc rate from `profile.proc_rate_overrides.TF_DOUBLE` with a
  vanilla default of 5%/level, 7%/level on PS; verified end-to-end that DPS
  scales correctly and that non-dagger weapons correctly get 0% proc despite
  having skill levels set). **Katar second-hit now implemented** — Katar
  auto-attack with `TF_DOUBLE` learned procs a second hit at 2× the normal
  `TF_DOUBLE` rate, dealing `(21 + 4 × AS_KATAR_lv)%` of the main-hit
  damage; both normal and crit variants computed, included in DPS, exposed
  as a separate branch in the damage breakdown. **PS Envenom weapon element
  and Enchant Poison passive bonus also implemented** — see serverProfiles
  entry below. Still deferred:
  `GS_CHAINACTION` proc (same shape as Double Attack but not yet ported),
  item autocasts, NJ_ISSEN's
  fixed-damage formula, CR_SHIELDBOOMERANG's special case, several small
  PS-only multiplicative bonuses (Cloaking, Lex Aeterna, Mailbreaker/Venom
  Dust/Raided, Backstab Opportunity, "performing" bonuses), `bDoubleRate`
  gear bonus (cards/items that add to Double Attack's proc chance — no
  consumer in `gearBonusAggregator.js` yet), and `bWeaponAtk` (needs a
  weapon-type → Hercules `W_*` constant table not transcribed here).
  **PS Hunter trap branch now implemented** — `_runTrapBranch` handles
  HT_LANDMINE, HT_BLASTMINE, HT_FREEZINGTRAP, HT_CLAYMORETRAP when
  `HT_TRAP_PS_FORMULA` mechanic flag is set; dispatched in `calculate()`
  before the generic BF_MISC fallback. Formula verified against the PDF's
  comparison table at Hunter 99/50 DEX150/INT100 for all four traps.
  **PS Assassin dual-wield now implemented** — three-hit model per
  auto-attack swing: hit 1 = RH × `AS_RIGHT` factor, hit 2 = same roll as
  hit 1 (×`AS_RIGHT` factor), hit 3 = LH × `AS_LEFT` factor. Mastery
  factors from serverProfiles `passive_overrides`; vanilla base penalties
  (RH 50%, LH 30%) apply at lv 0. Gated by `DUAL_WIELD_PS_THREE_HIT`
  mechanic flag. A `DUAL_WIELD_PS_DAMAGE_BONUS` mechanic flag (also set in
  PS profile) applies a ×1.10 multiplier to the combined total after mastery;
  propagated to the frontend as `dw_ps_bonus_pct` so headline range and DPS
  are consistent. UI: damage panel shows `[PS (3-hit) beta | Vanilla]` toggle
  when an off-hand weapon is equipped — PS mode shows combined damage range
  and two-section step list (with a bonus row when `dw_ps_bonus_pct > 0`);
  Vanilla mode recomputes single-weapon DPS.
  **PS Crusader rework implemented** — see "Done this pass".
  **PS Knight rework implemented** — see "Done this pass".
  **PS Rogue rework implemented** — Backstab Opportunity (×1.4, user-toggled
  via `support_buffs.backstab_opportunity`), Vulture's Eye bow Double Attack
  (`min(TF_DOUBLE_lv, AC_VULTURE_lv)` proc, `RG_BOW_DOUBLE_ATTACK` flag),
  Yser Card functional (`bSkillAtk` for RG_BACKSTAP/RG_RAID, +5 HIT).
  `bSkillAtk` is applied inside `calculateSkillRatio()` for the weapon branch.
  (An earlier pass also re-applied it in `_runBranch`, double-counting every
  weapon skill's `bSkillAtk` — that duplicate has since been removed.)
  **Cards always proc toggle implemented** — `gearBonusAggregator.compute()`
  now parses `autobonus` / `autobonus2` scripts from item scripts and stores
  them in `gearBonuses.auto_bonuses`. When `build.flags.force_procs` is set,
  the inner bonus effects are applied as permanent bonuses (and to `from_cards`
  when the source is a card slot). The `/calculate` route returns
  `has_auto_bonuses: boolean`; the frontend shows a "Cards always proc"
  checkbox in the damage breakdown panel when true, triggering immediate
  recalculation on toggle.
  **PS Wizard rework — 50% MDEF ignore** for `WZ_FIREPILLAR` and
  `HW_NAPALMVULCAN` wired via per-skill `mdefIgnorePct` parameter already
  present in `calculateMagicDefenseFix` (was always passed 0 before).
  **`NK_IGNORE_ELEMENT` now wired** — `damage_type: ["IgnoreElement"]` in the
  skill DB was never surfaced as a flag; `calculateAttrFix` always ran in
  `_runBranch`. Fixed by adding `skill.nk_ignore_ele` alongside the existing
  `nk_ignore_def`/`nk_ignore_flee` flags in `calculate()`; `_runBranch` now
  skips AttrFix when set. Primary beneficiary: `AS_SPLASHER` (Venom Splasher).
  **PS Sage rework implemented** (`Payon Stories Sage Rework Publication (Final).pdf`) —
  `MG_SOULSTRIKE`: 50% MDEF ignore via `MG_SOULSTRIKE_MDEF_IGNORE` flag (same pattern as
  Fire Pillar / Napalm Vulcan); +5% damage per skill level vs Undead race via
  `MG_SOULSTRIKE_UNDEAD_BONUS` flag, applied as a dedicated pipeline step after AttrFix.
  `MG_FIREBALL`: per-level table `40 + 30 × lv` (70%→340%) already stored in
  `PS_BF_MAGIC_RATIOS` — confirmed correct against published table.
  `WZ_EARTHSPIKE` / `WZ_HEAVENDRIVE`: 140% per hit already stored — confirmed correct.
  `SA_ADVANCEDBOOK`: flat ATK +10–30 and ASPD +3–7% at levels 1–5 already in
  `PS_PASSIVE_OVERRIDES` — confirmed correct.
  Volcano/Deluge/Violent Gale persistence buffs (max level 3) already stored and capped.
  **PS Gunslinger rework implemented** — verified all damage-relevant rework
  items: `GS_TRIPLEACTION` (140%/hit × 3 = 420% total, PS ratio `100+40×lv` at
  max level 1, was 450% vanilla); `GS_GROUNDDRIFT` (`200+60×lv`%, max 800% at
  lv 10, was `100+50×lv`%); `GS_MAGICALBULLET` (`50+DEX+BaseLvl`%); Heavy-Tipped
  Bullet (ATK 45, `bonus2 bAddRace,RC_All,10` — all already in PS data).
  **Neutral resist fixed**: `GS_DUST` was missing from `PS_PASSIVE_RESISTS` despite
  its description promising 7% Neutral resist at max level — now added. `GS_FULLBUSTER`
  and `GS_SPREADATTACK` resist now also triggers with Grenade Launcher
  (`weapon_types` updated to `["Shotgun","Grenade"]` for all three).
  Still deferred: `GS_CHAINACTION` proc,
  item autocasts, NJ_ISSEN's fixed-damage formula,
  CR_SHIELDBOOMERANG's special case, several small PS-only multiplicative
  bonuses (Cloaking, Lex Aeterna, Mailbreaker/Venom Dust/Raided,
  "performing" bonuses), `bDoubleRate` gear bonus, `bWeaponAtk`.

## Not yet started

- BF_MISC skills beyond Grand Cross and the PS trap branch
  (TF_THROWSTONE, NJ_ZENYNAGE, BA_DISSONANCE, etc.; GS_FLING now has its own
  branch) — still
  return "not yet implemented". HT_LANDMINE / HT_BLASTMINE /
  HT_FREEZINGTRAP / HT_CLAYMORETRAP are now implemented for the
  `PAYON_STORIES` profile (see "Done this pass"); non-PS profiles still
  return "not yet implemented" for these four.
- `GS_CHAINACTION` proc — same mechanic shape as `TF_DOUBLE` and the
  now-implemented `MO_TRIPLEATTACK`, not yet ported.
- ~~Gunslinger's coin economy~~ — **partly done 2026-08-21.** `build.gs_coins` now exists
  (0–10, Gunslinger-gated in the Buffs panel) and Fling consumes it. Asked for twice: an earlier
  report wanted "Coin amount" in the buffs panel, and a 2026-08-18 report asked for coins and Fling
  separately without realising they are one feature. Still unmodelled: coin ACCOUNTING for the
  buffs that cost coins, and `GS_BULLSEYE`'s "with coins" bleed chance — see the punch-list.
- `GS_FULLBUSTER` / `GS_SPREADATTACK` grant a passive elemental resist at
  skill level 10 with a Shotgun equipped (`profile.passive_resists` in
  `serverProfiles.js` — already engine-supported). Not surfaced in the
  passive-skill panel because both are active attack skills
  (`skill_type` non-empty), not true passives, and the panel's resist
  scope is damage-relevant masteries only, not defensive bonuses. Likely
  what a user report meant by "Shotgun passives" being missing; flagging
  here rather than silently expanding the passive panel's scope without
  confirming that's actually wanted.
- GUI parity: the original has 15 sections and 6 dialogs (combat controls,
  equipment/monster/skill browsers with rich filtering, build-vs-build
  comparison). The web frontend now covers stats, equipment with card
  slots, a passive-skill panel filtered to damage-relevant masteries, a
  buffs panel (quickens, Impositio Manus, Overthrust, Bard/Dancer songs —
  whatever the engine already read from `active_buffs`/`song_state` but had
  no UI for), consumables, target selection, skill selection, and the
  damage breakdown — still not full parity (no combat-controls panel, no
  build-vs-build comparison).
  **Performer stats closed a silent hole here (2026-08-17)**: `statusCalculator`
  had always read the PERFORMER's stats and Lesson level per song
  (`SC_POEMBRAGI_dex`, `SC_WHISTLE_agi`, …) but nothing ever wrote them, so every
  song computed at stat 1 / Lesson 0 — the weakest possible Bard. The panel now
  exposes one shared block per class (`bard_*` / `dancer_*` in `song_state`), which
  each song falls back to via `performerStat`/`performerLesson`; the older per-song
  keys still take precedence so pre-existing share URLs are unchanged. Also added
  **Service for You**, which the engine implemented (Max SP + SP-cost cut, matching
  the wiki's +25%/−50% at Lv10) but the picker never listed. Marked **beta**: the
  wiki publishes each song's endpoints and says the performer's stats affect them,
  but not the per-point rates — those are the pre-renewal emulator's
  (`skill.c:13556` for Bragi), unverified against in-game numbers.
- **Incoming damage from the target monster's *skills*** — _largely done_
  (`mobSkillRatios.js`, `resolveMobSkillDamage` in `routes/calculate.ts`,
  `components/SurvivabilityView.tsx`). A picked cast skill is priced through the
  incoming pipeline with the SAME ratio/hit precedence as the outgoing pipeline:
  `profile.weapon_ratios`/`magic_ratios` (PS-reworked, accurate) override the
  vanilla `BF_*` maps, which are trusted only where the `*_vanilla_ok` sets confirm
  PS matches vanilla (otherwise flagged **estimated**); monster-native `NPC_*`
  skills use a Hercules-baseline table (**estimates**); status/drain skills report
  "no direct damage". This picked up PS-only spells the vanilla maps lack
  (Lord of Vermilion, Fire Pillar) and corrected several vanilla-overcounted
  ratios (Meteor, Soul Strike, Napalm Vulcan). The size/element/race-dependent
  ratio & hit fns are evaluated against the player-as-target (Medium/Neutral/
  DemiHuman), so Pierce is 2 hits, and NEGATIVE `number_of_hits` (cosmetic
  multi-hit, e.g. Vermilion's −10) collapses to 1 instead of multiplying a
  total-ratio spell. Monster-clone skills (`MS_BASH`, `ML_PIERCE`,
  `MA_SHARPSHOOTING`) alias 1:1 onto their canonical player skill
  (`MOB_SKILL_ALIASES`). The `NPC_*` scaling ratios were **audited (2026-08-08)
  against Hercules `battle.c` and confirmed correct for pre-renewal** (Blood Drain
  100·lv, Energy Drain 100+100·lv, Dark Cross 100+35·lv; the rest 100% = normal
  attack). Since PS is pre-re and these are stock monster skills, the pre-re formula
  IS the value — but PS could still tune an individual one and they can't be
  measured in-game (mob-cast), so they remain flagged `estimated` ("for testing").
  **The Survivability UI now shows three explicit states:** accurate (no tag),
  **for testing** (pre-re baseline `NPC_*` / unaudited vanilla), and **not modeled
  yet** (damage skills with no reliable formula). **Remaining (genuinely blocked):**
  (1) Dark Breath (`FLAT_UNMODELED_SKILLS`) — Shadow %-max-HP hit whose power isn't
  publicly documented and is PS-tuned → now surfaced as **not modeled yet** rather
  than a fabricated number; (2) making the `NPC_*` estimates PS-*exact* is
  impossible without data (untestable mob-cast + no PS docs) — the pre-re baseline
  is the ceiling; (3) `ML_SPIRALPIERCE`/`LK_SPIRALPIERCE` (Spiral Pierce) has no
  modeled ratio on either side → also surfaced as **not modeled yet** until a ratio
  is added; likewise monster-cast 3rd-job skills (Crimson Rock, Sonic Wave, …).

## Planned front-end features (product)

These come from a "what would help a player simulate their character" review. The engine
already returns everything both need — they're largely frontend work.

### 1. Build-vs-build comparison  (in progress — on a feature branch)

The single most-used interaction for a damage calc: *"is A or B better?"* (card swaps, refine
levels, stat splits, gear choices). Pin the current build+result as a snapshot, then tweak the
editor and see the delta live. UI: a compare table whose columns are each pinned build plus the
current (live) result, and whose rows are the decision metrics — **DPS, average damage per hit,
time-to-kill** — with deltas colour-coded (green = better). Each pin can be reloaded into the
editor or removed. The original Python app had this (see "no build-vs-build comparison" under Not
yet started). Implementation: a `pins[]` array in `BuildEditor` holding `{label, metrics,
buildState}`; a `CompareView` component renders the table. Snapshot the full (shareable) build
state so pins survive edits and can be restored. Metrics come straight off `calcResult` —
`result.dps` (already effective), `result.normal.avg_damage`, and `target_hp / dps` for TTK.

### 2. "What to upgrade next" marginal-gain panel

For the current build+target, re-run the calc with **one thing changed** and rank the DPS gain of:
+1 refine on each equipped piece, the best card for each open slot, and +1 to each primary stat.
Shows the player the highest-leverage next purchase. Implementation: enumerate candidate
single-edits, call the existing `/calculate` endpoint for each, diff the DPS, sort. Debounce/cache
so it doesn't flood the backend (or add a batch endpoint). Natural follow-ons: a card recommender
and a stat optimiser (given N free points, maximise DPS/TTK).

## Done this pass (not in the original suggested order, picked up ad hoc)

- **Throw Kunai works in the calculator.**
  The ratio is vanilla 100% per hit (300% total because 3 hits). Confirmed by in-game tests, and RMS's vanilla description spells out that it's a total ("hit three times for a total of 300% attack").
  Added a `NJ_KUNAI: () => 100` entry to `PS_BF_WEAPON_RATIOS` purely to clear the BF_MISC guard
  (same reason as `NJ_SYURIKEN`'s entry above it) - the value itself is vanilla.
  The flat `+60` "Kunai Mastery" bonus in `masteryFix.js` applies regardless of whether a weapon
  is equipped. `battle.c:862-865`'s `if (weapon)` looked like an equipped-weapon check and briefly
  got gated on `weapon.weapon_type !== "Unarmed"` here, but that `weapon` bool is `flag.weapon`,
  which `battle_calc_weapon_attack` sets to 1 unconditionally and only clears for four shield
  skills (`battle.c:4846`/`4918`) - never for NJ_KUNAI.

- **An ammo's element was leaking into attacks that don't use that ammo, in both directions.**
  Two bugs:
  `resolveWeapon()`'s Unarmed branch returned `createWeapon()` before ever checking
  `script_atk_ele_rh` (the ammo's `bAtkEle` script), so a naked character's ammo-driven element
  was silently dropped - Throw Kunai when used without a weapon showed Neutral instead of the equipped Kunai's real element.
  Fixed: the early-return branch now resolves `elementOverride`/`script_atk_ele_rh` before
  falling back to Neutral.
  Fixing that exposed the opposite bug: the ammo element then applied unconditionally to EVERY
  attack, not just ones that use the ammo - a bare-handed punch with a Kunai equipped borrowed
  its Wind element. Fixed by extracting `skillUsesAmmo()` in `baseDamage.js` (the same
  AmmoTypes-requirement check already used for ammo ATK, from the earlier Acid Terror fix) and
  gating the element on it too, in `battlePipeline.js`'s element resolution.
  Regression-tested against the OTHER direction too: an Unarmed character with an elemental
  arrow equipped still gets nothing - arrows need a compatible weapon (`ammoFitsWeapon`), unlike
  kunai/shuriken, which are thrown by hand and were already exempt from that gate.

- **Swept the whole wiki (974 pages) for items the item API cannot describe, and added the
  one that mattered.** Of 140 item ids published in wiki tables the API knows 127; 8 of the
  rest were my own false positives (the regex caught an `atk` column sitting beside the Item
  ID column in a Gunslinger table) and one is a Halloween 2023 seasonal. Four were real, and
  the sweep turned up the wiki's **`List of Custom Items`** — 72 PS-custom items with ids,
  which is the canonical register for exactly the gear the API is weakest on. We had 69 of 72.
  - **ADDED: Ardent Helm (8417)** — a Crusader hidden-quest headgear the API has no data for
    under either its id or its name, so the wiki is the ONLY source. Its single documented
    mechanical effect is not on the item list at all but on the **Magnum Break** page: "The
    element of Magnum Break can be changed from Fire to Holy with the Ardent Helmet headgear."
    Modelled via a new PS-custom `bMagnumEle` bonus, following `bMagnumLinger` (also
    Magnum-Break-specific) rather than inventing a general per-skill element framework off a
    single data point. Measured: Fire→Undead 150% becomes Holy→Undead 175%, 897 → 1046 damage.
    **Deliberately omitted because nothing documents them:** DEF, refine bonuses, level
    requirement, and whether the lingering fire enchant also turns Holy — the enchant is a
    separate term and no source covers it, so it stays Fire. The item's `<ref>` to
    `Patch Note - 22 Jun 2026` is **broken** — that page never mentions it.
  - **NOT added: Blessing of the Ancients (8325)** — a consumable that casts Blessing 10 and
    Angelus 10, and only inside Payon Undertombs. Both buffs are already tickable in the buff
    panel, so the item itself carries no damage term the calculator does not already offer.
  - **NOT a gap: Frozen Pick.** The wiki lists it as **8293**, but the API resolves Frozen Pick
    to **8393** and says 8293 is Costume Onigiri Hat. We hold 8393 correctly — this is a wiki
    id error worth reporting to PS, not something to fix here. It matters because Frozen Pick
    is the item the Killing Stroke notes reference.
  `PS_SOURCES.md` now records the custom-items list as the fallback when the API says "No
  data", with both cautions attached (its ids can be wrong, its refs can be broken, and an
  item's real effect often lives on the SKILL's page). That text went into `gen_sources.py`,
  not the generated file — hand-editing PS_SOURCES.md would be wiped on the next regeneration.

- **Hand-authored items could ship with a working script and a blank tooltip.** Player-reported
  on **Giant Pestle (8430)**: every effect applied, but hovering showed nothing. `ps_item_manual`
  entries are written by hand, and it is easy to add a `script` — which changes damage, so tests
  and goldens notice — while forgetting `description`, which only appears on hover, so nothing
  does. This is the **second** report of exactly this (Rust-Worn Apparatus 81012 was the first),
  so it was fixed as a class rather than an instance: a sweep found **Whirling Hammer (8429)** and
  **Purifying Ring (81011)** with the same hole, both now filled verbatim from the item API.
  **Deliberately left blank: Talisman of Holy Protection (8324)** — the API returns "No data" for
  both its id and its name, so there is no source to copy. Its script is the only record of what
  it does, and generating tooltip copy from a script means inventing player-facing text, which is
  worse than a blank. `_note` records why and says to re-check the API, which has caught up on
  other items a day or two after a patch. It is the sole allowlist entry in the new guard.
  New test asserts every hand-authored item resolves a non-empty description, and names the API
  URL to copy from in its failure message. Sabotage-checked by blanking Giant Pestle again.
  (The CHANGELOG shape guard added minutes earlier then caught my own entry for THIS fix doubling
  a blank line — which is the first time that test has paid for itself.)

- **CHANGELOG.md is now shape-checked by a test**, after I broke it three separate ways in
  one stretch of work: four days of entries filed under a stale `## 2026-08-22` heading
  (every insert script hardcoded that date — the same drift I had *already* repaired once in
  this file), a doubled blank line before every entry I inserted (`FIXED` strings ending in
  `

`), and then an empty orphaned `## 2026-08-22` heading left behind by an off-by-one
  in the repair itself (sliced at index 8 where the heading sat at index 7). The user caught
  all three. The file is edited by script often enough that "read it and see" is not a real
  check, so `frontend-source.test.js` now asserts: one heading per date, dates newest-first,
  no heading without content, one `### <type>` per date from the Keep a Changelog set, and no
  run of two or more blank lines. Each failure mode was sabotage-verified.
  Normalising the whole file for that test also merged **pre-existing** duplicate sections in
  the July entries (2026-07-01 / 07-10 / 07-13), which I had spotted during the 2026-08-22
  audit and consciously left alone at the time. 47 date sections normalised, 442 entries
  verified present before and after.

- **Forgeable weapons are marked in the item picker**, and the UI regression guards got a
  proper home. Whether a weapon is Blacksmith-forgeable is otherwise invisible until after you
  equip it, so the dropdown now carries a small "Forgeable" pill on both weapon searches (the
  main slot and the off-hand one, which mixes shields and weapons — shields are never forgeable
  and stay unmarked).
  Deliberately generic: `SearchResult` gained optional `badge`/`badgeTitle`, `SearchPicker`
  renders whatever it is handed and **knows nothing about forging**, so the same mechanism can
  mark anything later. Styled after `.beta-badge` (outlined, muted, uppercase mono) rather than
  the unused gold `.badge` — this is metadata in a long list and must not compete with the accent
  the damage numbers use; it lifts to accent only on the highlighted row, where the muted grey
  would otherwise lose contrast against `--accent-soft`.
  **New `test/frontend-source.test.js`.** There is no frontend test runner, so UI fixes had been
  landing as source-level guards inside `protected-values.test.js` — which is about the handful of
  values deciding where money goes and who the site credits, and only stays readable if it is not
  also a dumping ground. The forge-clearing and saved-build-name guards moved out into the new
  file, joined by the badge guard and a **cross-stack check that the frontend's copy of
  `FORGEABLE_WEAPON_IDS` still matches the engine's** — `BuildEditor.tsx` duplicates the list so
  the picker can badge without a round-trip, and its own comment asks for them to be kept in sync,
  which nothing enforced until now. Desyncing one id fails 5 tests.

- **A saved build's name was stored on the entry but not in the state.** Player-reported.
  `SavedBuildsModal.handleSave()` called `saveBuild(name, currentState)`, but `currentState` is
  snapshotted from the editor BEFORE `onSave(name)` pushes the new name into `data` — so the
  persisted `state.build.name` was the PREVIOUS name while `entry.name` (what the list renders)
  was correct. `onLoadSavedState` does `setData(state.build)`, so loading restored the stale
  name: a build saved once from a fresh editor came back as **"New Build"**.
  **That ordering explains the reporter's "only 1 build" symptom** — re-saving snapshots a
  `data` that now holds the right name, so every build saved twice silently repaired itself.
  Only save-once builds stayed broken, which is exactly the pattern they described.
  Fixed at both ends: `handleSave` now bakes the typed name into the state it persists, and
  **Load overrides `build.name` with the entry's own name** — the second half matters because a
  code fix alone would leave already-broken saves wrong forever in the user's browser.
  Guarded in `protected-values.test.js` alongside the forge fix (no frontend test runner) and
  sabotage-checked by reverting the save to the raw snapshot.

- **Forge data outlived the weapon it belonged to, hiding the next weapon's card slots.**
  Player-reported via a share link. `data.forge` is keyed by SLOT (`forge.right_hand`) but
  describes a SPECIFIC forged weapon, and neither the item picker nor Unequip cleared it. So
  swapping weapons carried the old one's crumbs/element across, `isForged` stayed true, and the
  card-slot pickers — deliberately hidden for forged weapons, whose slots hold the crafter's
  signature — never rendered for the new weapon.
  **The failure mode is worse than it first looks.** The forge UI is gated on
  `FORGEABLE_WEAPON_IDS`, so swapping to a non-forgeable weapon hides the forge controls while
  the stale flag persists: the slots are gone, nothing on screen explains why, and there is no
  control left to switch it off. The reporter's build was a forged Damascus (1222, `sc:2`,
  `ele:3`) → Main Gauche; 1207 [3] is forgeable but 1208 [4] is not, so the dead-end case was
  one click away. Decoded from their share link rather than guessed at.
  Both paths now delete `forge[slot.key]` — the picker only when the id actually changes, so
  re-picking the same weapon keeps its forge setup. Guarded by a source-level test in
  `protected-values.test.js` (there is no frontend test runner; same precedent as
  `buff-labels.test.js` parsing `BuildEditor.tsx`), sabotage-checked by removing the cleanup.
  Not related to the earlier wildcard slot-count fix, which was my first suspicion — that one
  governs which wildcard BONUSES apply, not whether the slot UI renders.

- **Regression fix (same day, self-inflicted): PS-custom skills were forced Short.**
  Making `skillRangeAtLevel` read `skills.json` `range` turned a field that had never mattered
  into a load-bearing one — and `dataLoader._psCustomBattleSkills()` SYNTHESIZES its records
  with a placeholder `range: [1]`. Every PS-custom battle skill therefore classified Short,
  costing bow Rogues `bLongAtkRate` on Trick Arrow and Quick Step (Long/385 → Short/351 with an
  Archer Skeleton Card). Not one of the 11 label-only golden flips — a real damage change, and
  it shipped in `47d794e`.
  **The first fix was also wrong**, which is the more useful lesson. Falling back to
  `rec.range` looked right until it turned out `ps_skill_db` scrapes `range` as **prose** —
  `"9 Cells + Vulture's Eye"` — so the value reaching `range >= 5` was a STRING. That compares
  false against a number, so it still failed Short, just for a different reason and just as
  silently. Fixed properly in two places: the synthesized record now uses a numeric **`[-1]`**
  sentinel (Hercules' "use the weapon's range"), and `skillRangeAtLevel` rejects anything that
  is not a finite number rather than comparing it. A test pins both the behaviour and the
  sentinel's type, and fails if the `[1]` placeholder returns.

- **Long/short is now the SKILL's range, not the weapon's** (`resolveIsRanged`). This was a
  documented stub — the function already took a `skill` argument and threw it away under a
  `NOT YET PORTED` comment. Hercules `battle_range_type()`:
  `if (skill->get_range2(...) < 5) return BF_SHORT; return BF_LONG;`, and `skill_get_range2()`
  resolves a **NEGATIVE** range to the wielder's weapon range. That negative case is the common
  one (Bash is `-1`), which is exactly why weapon-only logic looked right for most skills and was
  quietly wrong for the rest.
  **Three independent PS wiki statements confirm the `<5` cutoff, and one of them runs the
  OPPOSITE way**, which is what makes this more than a code reading:
  - *Grimtooth* (range `2+lv` = 3,4,5,6,7): "Level 1 and level 2 are considered melee (can be
    blocked by Safety Wall) while level 3 and above are considered ranged (can be blocked by
    Pneuma)" — the flip lands exactly on the cutoff, and it is **per level**. The same page adds
    a mechanical tell: "Arrows only work with long range attacks so the only skill Assassins have
    that will benefit from this is Grimtooth (level 3 or above)".
  - *Throw Kunai* (range 9): "This is a RANGED attack even if you are standing 1 cell from the
    target."
  - *Desperado* — **a gun skill that is MELEE.** It has no `Range:` line in Hercules at all (so 0),
    and PS says: "Desperado is considered melee, which means cards like Earth and Sky Deleter work
    with it, but **Archer skeleton does not**." Archer Skeleton Card is `bLongAtkRate`, the single
    thing this flag feeds — so the wiki is describing our exact code path. We were classifying it
    Long (revolver = ranged weapon) and **paying out a long-range bonus PS says it does not get**.
    Verified before/after: Desperado + Archer Skeleton is now 3480 → 3480 (ignored), while Throw
    Shuriken + the same card goes 225 → 247.
  **Golden movement is 11 step-name flips and ZERO damage or DPS changes** — no golden build wears
  `bLongAtkRate` gear, so the label moves and the number does not. The damage only diverges once
  someone equips one of the nine such items. Sabotage-checked both halves: reverting to
  weapon-derived fails 10 tests, and treating a negative range literally (which would break
  Tracking and Bash) fails 3.

- **Throw Shuriken was still ignoring Flee.** `skills.json` marks `NJ_SYURIKEN` `IgnoreFlee`
  (vanilla), and `battlePipeline.js` read that with no override, so it always hit with a 100% chance.
  The skill's PS description states: "No longer ignores
  Flee" (`ps_skill_db.json`).
  Fixed with a pipeline override behind a new `NJ_SYURIKEN_FLEE_IGNORE_DISABLED` flag - vanilla
  data and the `standard` profile untouched. Tested against a 296-Flee target: matches
  `calculateHitChance`'s real answer now instead of always hitting.

- **Throw Shuriken now works at all, and is paced by attack MOTION rather than delay.**
  It was returning a flat **0 damage**: the skill is typed `Misc` and had no ratio in either
  ratio map, so the BF_MISC guard reported it unmodelled. Three parts, all now in:
  - **Damage.** A 100% entry in `weapon_ratios` purely to get past that guard — the wiki gives
    no % ratio, only flat ATK. Its own **+5/lv** is applied in `masteryFix` alongside Throwing
    Mastery's existing +3/lv, both **after Defense Fix**, because the Ninja page says the two
    "act like mastery damage and therefore bypass normal defense". Shuriken ammo ATK feeds it
    normally (205 → 242 across the ammo tiers at Lv10).
  - **Speed — the reported half.** A player: *"Throw Shuriken is based on an attack motion,
    instead of a delay. Generally ~half of a delay. tl;dr 2x aspd."* `adelay` is exactly
    `2 x amotion`, so the period is `amotion` and the skill fires at **twice** the auto-attack
    rate. Wired through **`ps_attack_interval`, the second empty hook** (`(status, amotion)`),
    which REPLACES the period — so it also bypasses the 200 ms minimum skill delay, matching
    the wiki's "Throw Shuriken bypasses this at higher attack speeds".
  - **My earlier note was wrong and is corrected above.** I had written that the pacing would
    come out right on its own via the ASPD floor. That floor is `adelay` — double the correct
    value — so acting on it would have shipped the skill at half speed. The player's report is
    what caught it.
  Corroboration for the pacing is independent: the wiki's own note ("~9.1 times per second at
  190 ASPD") is the same claim. It carries a `*Confirmation needed` marker and our model gives
  10/s at 190 ASPD (`amotion` floors at 100 ms), a ~10% disagreement on an explicitly unconfirmed
  figure — recorded, not chased.
  **Range classification: RESOLVED and implemented — see the next entry.** It is range 9 and is
  long-range; a player confirmed it plays as ranged.

- **Throwing Mastery's HIT half did nothing** (`passive_overrides.NJ_TOBIDOUGU`). Player-reported.
  `statusCalculator` has always had the code — `status.hit += perLv * njTobiLv` — but it reads
  `perLv` from `passive_overrides.NJ_TOBIDOUGU.hit_per_lv` **defaulting to 0**, and the PS profile
  had no entry. So the block was a silent no-op and the Ninja's *only* passive in the picker
  delivered half of what its own description promises ("Increase Throw Shuriken damage **and
  accuracy**"). Now `{ hit_per_lv: 2 }` → +20 HIT at Lv10, per
  wiki.payonstories.com/Throwing_Mastery.
  **PS-only, verified against source rather than assumed:** `NJ_TOBIDOUGU` appears nowhere in
  Hercules `status.c`, which is where a HIT bonus would live — only in `battle.c` as
  `case NJ_SYURIKEN: damage += 3 * skill2_lv`. That is why the hook existed defaulting to 0. The
  standard profile stays flat and a test asserts it, so the PS bonus cannot leak into vanilla.
  **The two halves have DIFFERENT scopes, and this is the part worth not getting wrong.** The ATK
  is Shuriken-only (vanilla gates it, and `masteryFix` matches on `skill.name === "NJ_SYURIKEN"`).
  The HIT is **global** — despite the skill's own one-line summary reading "…and accuracy" as if
  scoped, and despite the class-page skill table saying "+HIT to Throw Shuriken". The Ninja page's
  build prose settles it three ways: "Thanks to the large boost to HIT provided by Throwing
  Mastery, these ninja can get away with having lower DEX than what is normal for physical damage
  builds"; "Throwing Mastery makes DEX less of a priority"; and decisively, in the Shadow Slash
  notes, "Though the bonus damage to Throw Shuriken is irrelevant to these ninja, **the bonus to
  HIT could make other skills like Haze Slasher more practical to use**". Recorded in the profile
  comment so nobody narrows it back to match the summary table.
  No golden moved — no scenario sets `NJ_TOBIDOUGU`. Sabotage-checked three ways: removing the
  entry, changing the per-level value, and leaking it into the vanilla profile.

- **The `4*AGI + 2*DEX` after-cast reduction now reaches Assassin and Ninja, not just Monk.**
  `skillTiming` has always applied this, but only to `MONK_COMBO_SKILLS`, so three skills the
  wiki documents identically sat at their full DB delay and read far too slow. Added as
  `PS_SKILL_DELAY_FN` through the **`ps_skill_delay_fn` hook that already existed and was
  empty** — it REPLACES the DB delay (the Monk branch subtracts from it), and runs before the
  percentage reductions so Bragi and delayrate gear still stack on top as they should.
  | skill | formula | period before → after | DPS |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `AS_SONICBLOW` | `2000 - (4*AGI + 2*DEX)` | 2000 → 1424 ms | ×1.40 |
  | `NJ_KUNAI` | `1000 - (4*AGI + 2*DEX)` | 1000 → 532 ms | ×1.88 |
  | `NJ_KASUMIKIRI` | `1000 - (4*AGI + 2*DEX)` | 1000 → 532 ms | ×1.88 |
  (at AGI 90 / DEX 80 base). All three DB bases already matched the wiki (2000/1000/1000), but
  the base is written out explicitly at each entry so the formula reads next to its source
  rather than depending on a scraped number staying right.
  **Note the ASPD floor binds first for the two 1000 ms skills**: the raw formula gives 448 ms
  where the attack animation is 532 ms, and `skillPeriodMs` takes `max(delay, ASPD delay)` — you
  cannot cast faster than you can swing. That is why the tests assert `max(formula, aspdFloor)`
  rather than the formula alone; asserting the formula would have been wrong at high AGI.
  Only one golden moved (`assassin-sonic-blow-lv10`: period 2000 → 1484, DPS 1272 → 1715);
  damage is untouched, this is purely rate. Kunai and Haze Slasher had no coverage at all, so
  both got scenarios. Sabotage-checked three ways: unwiring the hook, dropping the DEX half of
  the formula, and **adding `NJ_HUUMA` by pattern-matching** — the last of which the test
  explicitly guards against, because Huuma is still blocked on an in-game timing.

- **Pinned the values that must not drift** (`test/protected-values.test.js`, wired into
  `npm test` so CI gates the deploy on it). Written for a repo that is about to take
  outside contributions: most of it should stay easy to change, but a few values decide
  **where money goes, who the site claims to be, and who it credits**, and each can be
  altered in a one-line diff that looks harmless in review.
  - **Ko-fi.** The page id (`KOFI_PAGE`) is pinned, both URLs must be built from it on
    `https://ko-fi.com`, and the whole component may reference no other host — a
    typosquat like `ko-fi.co` keeps the id and still takes the money. A second sweep
    asserts no payment host (ko-fi/paypal/patreon/buymeacoffee) appears **anywhere else**
    under either `src/`, so a rival "Support us" button cannot bypass the first check.
    That sweep is deliberately blunt and trips on comments too: a false alarm costs a
    sentence in review, a missed one costs every donation until somebody notices.
  - **Identity.** `index.html`'s canonical and `og:url`, plus `gen-guides.mjs`'s `SITE`,
    must all agree on `https://openpscalc.com` — a wrong canonical hands this site's
    search ranking to whatever it points at, and the generator stamps its own copy into
    every page it writes.
  - **Attribution** to `StatGameDev/Open_PS_Calc` in the README. The only item here that
    is a licence condition rather than a preference.
  - **Data sources.** The audit tooling may fetch from `payonstories.com` and nowhere
    else; repointing it would make every number suspect while the app still looked fine.
  Nothing is frozen — the mechanism is that changing one **also** requires changing this
  test in the same commit, which turns a silent edit into a visible one. All six attack
  scenarios were run against it (redirect the id, typosquat the host, repoint the
  canonical, desync the generator domain, strip attribution, add a second donation link
  in an unrelated file) and each one fails the suite. A `## Contributing` section in the
  README explains it, so it reads as a documented rule rather than a mystery failure.
  **Not done, and worth considering separately:** a `CODEOWNERS` file plus branch
  protection would add a human review requirement on these paths. That is a GitHub
  settings change rather than a repo change, so it is left to the maintainer.

- **Swept the LIVE PS item DB for anything we are missing (2026-08-23).** There is no bulk
  endpoint, so `tools/audit/fetch_ps_items.py` harvests it two ways: `?name=` is a substring
  match with a 3-character minimum, so every 3-gram occurring in a known item name is
  queried (that reaches anything sharing a trigram with something we already have), plus a
  straight id scan of the 90000-92000 custom block, whose names can look like nothing in the
  vanilla DB. **3,032 ids came back that we lack — and essentially none of them matter.**
  The breakdown is the useful part: 886 costumes, and the rest boxes/containers, candies and
  consumables, or **Renewal 3rd-job gear** (Illusion/Beginner Sura, Warlock, Geneticist,
  Kagerou/Oboro) that pre-renewal PS cannot equip. Of 525 ids in the weapon/armour ranges,
  every single one with a real weapon `Class:` line turned out to be a **Box** quoting its
  contents (Rudra Bow Box, Moonlight Sword Box, Wrench Box). So our equipment coverage for
  damage purposes was already complete — a negative result worth recording so this does not
  get re-investigated.
  **Three equippable items were genuinely missing** and are now added: **Brass Wristwatch
  (81002)** — an Accessory **[1]**, the one that actually matters, because the card slot is
  the point even though it has no innate stats — plus **Luck o' Pint (80066)** and
  **Leprecoin (80067)**, stat-less St. Patrick's event pieces added so a build can represent
  what is worn. Costumes are deliberately NOT imported: they carry no stats and we do not
  model a costume slot, so 886 of them would only bloat the picker.
- **Confirmed the bullet/grenade ammo question from the wiki** (raised when the item API
  disagreed with our subtypes). The Gunslinger page carries two explicit lists:
  *"Bullets are gunslinger specific ammunition used with Revolvers, Rifles, Shotguns and
  Gatlings"* — Bullet 13200, Armor Piercing 13233, Hollow-Point 13234, Heavy Tipped 13235,
  Plated 91126 — and *"Grenades are … used with Grenade Launchers"* — Thud 91127, Heavy
  Explosive 91121, Flashbang 91122, Stun 91123, Sticky 91124, Ghosthunter 91125.
  **Thud Grenade is a GRENADE**, so our `A_GRENADE` was right and the API's `Class: Bullet`
  on it is the unreliable reading — the API's `Class:` line is coarse and says "Bullet" for
  most rounds. Not changing the subtypes was the correct call. The Sphere rounds
  (13203-13207) appear in **neither** list, so PS does not document them; left as the
  vanilla `A_GRENADE`.
- **Armor Piercing Bullet was missing its Rifle bonus.** The wiki's bullet table says
  "+10 Crit, **+20 Crit with Rifle**", footnoted "Both bonuses count for Rifle, making it
  +30 Crit while using Armor Piercing Bullets with Rifles". Only the flat +10 was
  implemented. Needed a weapon-type test, which the parser had no way to express, so
  `isweapontype("Rifle")` was added — a **ps_item_manual-layer predicate**, in the same
  spirit as the PS-custom bonus names, since Hercules spells this as
  `getiteminfo(getequipid(EQI_HAND_R),11)==W_RIFLE` and this parser has no
  `getiteminfo`/`getequipid`. `weapon_type` is threaded into the script context alongside
  the existing `weapon_level`.
  **Worth knowing how this nearly shipped wrong:** the predicate's regex was written with a
  literal **backspace byte** (`` through a non-raw Python string — the same trap already
  recorded in this file), so it never matched, the `if()` condition became unevaluatable, and
  `evalConditionals` **FAILS OPEN** and took the true branch — quietly granting +20 crit to
  every weapon including grenade launchers. The fail-open is deliberate and documented, but
  it means a broken predicate is silent rather than loud. Both the outcome (Revolver must
  gain only +10) and the predicate itself are now pinned by tests.

- **Destroyer [3] was missing, and Ghosthunter Grenade's Ghost element never applied.**
  Two Gunslinger reports from the same player.
  - **Destroyer (13160)** is `slots=3` on the live item API but `0` in the vanilla
    `item_db`, so the 3-slot version simply did not exist in the picker while
    Destroyer [1] (13161, slots=1 in both) was there. Fixed in `ps_item_manual.json`.
  - **Ghosthunter Grenade (91125)** carried `element: 8` with an **empty script**. The
    engine takes a weapon's element from `gearBonuses.script_atk_ele_rh`, populated from
    the ammo's `bonus bAtkEle` — **the `element` data field alone does nothing**. That is
    why Flare / Freezing / Blind Sphere (all of which script `bAtkEle`) worked and this
    one silently hit as Neutral. Live API confirms "Element: Ghost". Now scripted, and
    a test asserts **no** ammo anywhere has an element field without the matching
    `bAtkEle`, so the class of bug is closed rather than the one instance.
  - Audited all 24 Gunslinger ammo entries against the API while in here; Ghosthunter was
    the only element that failed to apply. **Left alone deliberately:** the API labels
    the Sphere rounds (13203-13207) "Class: Bullet" where we and the vanilla item_db have
    them as `A_GRENADE`, and the same for Thud Grenade (91127). Changing a subtype moves
    which weapons accept which ammo through `ammoFitsWeapon`, the API's `Class:` line
    looks coarse (it says "Bullet" for most rounds while saying "Grenade" for the 9112x
    customs), and no player has reported it — so it is recorded here rather than guessed at.

- **Gunslinger coins were worth nothing** (`forgeBonus.js` `calculateSpiritSphereBonus`).
  Held coins grant **+3 ATK each, multiplied by the skill's hit count** — the same flat
  Star-Crumb-position add Monk spirit spheres get — but the bonus was gated behind
  `MONK_LINE_JOBS`, so a Gunslinger holding a full pool of 10 saw no change at all.
  Verified against source rather than inferred, after the first pass leaned too hard on
  one wiki line:
  - `skill.c` `case GS_GLITTERING:` (Flip the Coin) calls `pc->addspiritball(sd, …, 10)`
    — **coins ARE `sd->spiritball`**, and that 10 is where the coin cap comes from.
  - `battle.c` `ATK_ADD(wd.div_ * sd->spiritball * 3)`, inside `#ifndef RENEWAL` (PS is
    pre-re), sits beside the Star Crumb `ATK_ADD2` and immediately before
    `battle->calc_cardfix`. That one line establishes all four properties — +3 each,
    ×hit-count, past DEF, affected by cards — and carries **no job check**.
  - PS keeps it: the wiki's Gunslinger page says "Each coin adds +3 dmg to your attacks"
    and the Flip Coin page calls the coins "similar to monk spirits". The Monk side is
    spelled out separately on Call Spirits ("+3 ATK that ignores enemy defense and flee",
    "affected by cards but not by elements") — the same behaviour, as expected.
  Practical effect: 10 coins are +30 on a single-hit attack, **+90 on Triple Action (3
  hits) and +180 on Desperado Lv10 (6 hits)**. No existing golden moved — no scenario had
  ever set a coin.
- **The coin field no longer deducts stance costs.** Barrage (2 coins) and Run and Gun (1)
  were being charged against the pool, so the panel told Gunslingers they were short of
  coins they would actually be holding. The cost is paid when the stance goes up and Coin
  Flip refills in one 3-second cast, so by the time you attack you have both. The field
  now means "coins in hand as you act", and shows the +ATK they are worth. Barrage's own
  +30% damage was already modelled correctly (verified: auto 206→267, Desperado
  3414→4438), and Barrage/Run and Gun mutual exclusion was already wired. Player-reported.

- **Meteor Storm and Lord of Vermilion: the two multi-hit gaps from the 2026-08-22
  audit, now closed** — plus the 15 stale item tooltips it found.
  - **Meteor Storm** was pricing Lv10 at **5 hits instead of 35**. `skills.json`
    `number_of_hits` ([1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]) is only the wiki's *Hits/Meteor* column;
    the **meteor count** scales too (2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7) and we ignored it. Now a
    `magic_hit_counts` entry of meteors × hits ([2,3,6,8,12,15,20,24,30,35]). A target
    takes every meteor: they land on random cells of a 5×5 grid but each carries a 7×7
    AoE (±3), so even a corner meteor covers the centre — the same all-hits-land
    assumption already used for Storm Gust.
  - **Lord of Vermilion** was one lump, so the target's **soft MDEF was subtracted
    once where the game subtracts it four times**. It lands in 4 waves of
    `(20 × lv × waveNumber)%` — 200/400/600/800% at Lv10, summing to the wiki table's
    200×lv total, which is why the total was right and the mitigation wasn't. A target
    takes one hit per *wave*, not per bolt: the wiki ties both flinch ("1 second per
    wave that they are hit by") and the Silence roll ("1% × Skill Level per wave") to
    waves. **The waves escalate, so this could not go through `magic_hit_counts`** —
    hence `_runVermilionBranch`, which runs the magic branch once per wave and
    convolves. Four EQUAL waves of 50×lv looked equivalent (soft MDEF is a flat
    per-hit subtraction and everything after is multiplicative) and I nearly shipped
    that, but measuring it showed the two diverge once a single wave floors at minimum
    damage — wave 1 is only 20×lv% MATK, so at **Lv1 the shortcut understated damage
    by up to 97%** against a high-INT target. Verified against a hand-written exact
    reference across MATK 60-535 × Lv 1/5/10 × soft MDEF 0/90/150.
  - Golden movement on the existing LoV scenario is **−47 (−0.55%)**, exactly the 3
    extra soft-MDEF subtractions. Two scenarios added, including LoV **Lv1 vs a
    high-INT target** — the case the shortcut got wrong.
  - **All 15 stale item tooltips synced** to the live item API via a new repeatable
    `tools/audit/sync_descriptions.py` (descriptions only — scripts are hand-authored
    and were the correct half in every one of these). Doing it turned up two things a
    text-only sync would have buried: **Stone Discus** also boosts **Shield Charge**
    per the API (the Crusader PDF named only Shield Boomerang; the API is the later
    source and has precedent for carrying terms the PDFs omit), which is a real script
    gap now fixed; and **Pirate Skel Card's override description was another card's
    text entirely** ("Enables Level 5 Discount"), hidden until now because its manual
    description shadowed it. Setting Dirk (trap 5%) and Pill Bug (Cart Revolution 10%)
    were checked the same way and their scripts were already right — only the text lied.
    `audit_items.py` now reports **0 drift, 0 unimplemented**.

- **Full skill + item audit against the wiki, the scraped PS DB and the rework PDFs
  (2026-08-22).** Pulled all 399 base/2nd-job wiki pages as raw wikitext through the wiki's
  MediaWiki API (`wiki.payonstories.com/api.php` is open — no HTML scraping, no summarising),
  extracted the per-level damage tables and prose formulas, and diffed them against all 56 PS
  ratios we model, `ps_skill_db.json`, and all 15 rework PDFs. **Every source is now recorded
  verbatim in `PS_SOURCES.md`** so this never again requires the PDFs, which live outside the
  repo. Findings:
  - **FIXED — `GS_TRACKING` was overstated.** Was `100 + 160×lv`; the Gunslinger PDF says
    "Increased damage to 160 × Skill Lvl, so 1600% at Skill Lvl 10", the wiki PROSE says
    "Does 160*SkillLvl% damage", and `ps_skill_db.json` lists 160…1600. The only source for
    the extra +100 was the wiki's own TABLE, which contradicts its own prose and mis-steps at
    Lv4 (640, breaking its +160 progression). Lv1 260%→160%, Lv10 1700%→1600%.
  - **OPEN — Shield Boomerang Lv1.** Wiki table says 130%; ours and `ps_skill_db` say 140%.
    Levels 2-5 agree exactly (180/220/260/300). The same wiki page's prose says
    `2.5*(ATK+Shield Weight)` at rank 5 while its table says 300%, so that page is internally
    inconsistent. Left at 140 (4 of 5 levels fit `100+40×lv`); needs an in-game check.
  - **Six skills where the WIKI is stale and we are right** — `KN_SPEARSTAB` (Knight PDF
    `100+40*SkillLevel`, wiki still shows `100+20`), `AM_ACIDTERROR` (Alchemist PDF "NEW
    FORMULA: (100+100*SkillLv)%", wiki + DB still 500% max), `RG_BACKSTAP` (Rogue PDF
    "reduced ... to 200%+30%*Skill_Level", wiki shows `200+40×lv`), `KN_BOWLINGBASH`,
    `AS_GRIMTOOTH`, `MO_FINGEROFFENSIVE`. **Now pinned by tests** so a future wiki-driven
    pass can't "correct" them back. Two of these were nearly filed as bugs off the wiki alone
    — the PDFs reversed both, which is why the source hierarchy matters.
  - `ps_skill_db.json` "differences" for `MO_TRIPLEATTACK` (28/26/24…), `GS_PIERCINGSHOT`
    (3/6/9…) and `WZ_METEOR` (5/10/15…) are **scraper artifacts** — proc chance and bleed
    chance picked up as damage. Not real; recorded so they aren't re-flagged.
  - **Two modelling gaps, not ratio errors.** `WZ_METEOR`: we apply 100% MATK ×
    `number_of_hits`, but that array is *hits per meteor*; the wiki gives a separate meteor
    count that also scales (2→7), so a target under the full storm can take 7×5 = 35 hits
    (~3500% MATK) where we cap at 500%. `WZ_VERMILION`: our 2000% total at Lv10 matches the
    wiki's summed waves, but we apply it as ONE lump where the wiki says 4 bundles of 20
    hits — and since soft MDEF is subtracted per hit, lumping OVERestimates damage vs
    high-MDEF targets, the exact trap the magic branch's own comment warns about for bolts.
  - **Items** — checked all 241 hand-authored plus 940 PS-overridden entries against the live
    item API (`?id=` works and is exact). Fixed three: **SCOUT Card** still granted
    `bCastrate,MO_THROWSPIRIT,-10` that the Monk rework removed ("Old: +1 STR, -10% cast time
    …; New: +1 STR") — a free DPS bonus for TSS Monks; **Purple Cowboy Hat (5816)** had no
    script at all so its "Atk +15, Flee -5" did nothing; **Witch's Pumpkin Hat (18656)**
    carried the vanilla script for an id PS repurposed (MDEF 10 vs the API's 4, plus STR/INT
    the PS text doesn't list). Its +15% vs Undead/Demon is kept magic-only — the PS wording
    says "Damage" unqualified, so that half is a judgement call recorded in its `_note`.
  - **15 items have stale DESCRIPTIONS but correct scripts** (Grizzly 30→100%, Flame Beetle
    20→50%, Tengu 25→10%, Ancient Mummy Lv5/10 → Lv3/5, …). The scripts are hand-maintained
    and the text is scraped, so damage is right and only the tooltip misleads. Not yet fixed.
  - Set/combo bonuses flagged by the scan (Dark Knight Belt, Diabolus Robe, Bloody Iron Ball,
    Fur Seal set) **are** covered by the combo DB — false positives. `Manteau of Survival`'s
    "[+ Rod of Survival]" combo genuinely has no entry, but it's a rental; left alone.

- **ASPD breakpoints report 0.1 steps, not just integer crossings** (`aspdBreaks` in
  `routes/calculate.ts`). The atomic ASPD step is **0.1, not 1**: `statusCalculator`
  sets `aspd = (2000 - amotion) / 10` from an INTEGER `amotion`, and `amotion` IS the
  attack delay, so each 0.1 is one tick — `animation_ms` moves 2 ms per 0.1. Whole-number
  ASPD is a player convention, not a mechanical threshold. The old `aspdBreaks` emitted a
  row only when `Math.floor(a) > lastInt` and reported `Math.floor(a)`, so it (a) hid every
  sub-integer gain and (b) rounded the milestone DOWN. Measured on an AGI-80 Assassin with
  a dagger: of the 98 AGI points that raise ASPD at all, only **20** cross a whole number —
  the row was surfacing about a fifth of the real gains, and understating each one.
  Now returns `{plus, aspd, whole}` with the EXACT value, taking the next 3 fine steps plus
  the next 2 whole-number milestones for AGI (2 + 1 for DEX); `whole` is tracked even for
  crossings that aren't emitted, so the flag stays truthful. The at-cap path (empty array →
  "at cap") is unchanged and was re-verified by temporarily lowering `config.max_aspd`.
  Route internals aren't reachable from the test suite (`routes/` is TS, `npm test` runs
  plain JS), so the guard added is at the engine layer instead: ASPD is always a clean 0.1
  multiple, sub-integer AGI gains provably exist, and 0.1 ASPD is worth 2 ms.

- **Killing Stroke: Mirror Image bonus modeled, and its fabricated DPS removed.**
  Two player reports in one. (1) `NJ_ISSEN` has **every timing array zeroed** in the
  skill DB, so `calculateSkillTiming` returned `0 + 0` and the shared
  `Math.max(castMs + delayMs, 100)` floor turned that into a 100 ms period — the
  panel was advertising **ten Killing Strokes a second, 60,890 DPS** for a skill that
  drops you to 1 HP. It is a one-shot by construction (the cast also cancels the Ninja
  Aura it *requires*), so the branch now returns `dps: null` / `dps_valid: false` /
  `period_ms: 0` rather than a floor-derived fiction. (2) Mirror Image
  (`SC_NJ_BUNSINJYUTSU`) raises this skill's damage by **(5 + 5×ImagesLeft)%**, 10% at
  one image to 30% at five, on non-PvP/GvG maps — we only price PvM, so it always
  applies when set. Added as a buff-picker entry whose **level is the number of images
  LEFT, not the skill level**: the skill grants `ceil(lv/2)` images (Lv1-2 → 1 …
  Lv9-10 → 5, per `skill_descriptions.json`), and the formula reads how many are still
  standing at cast time. Applied last as its own breakdown step, clamped to 5.
  Sources: `wiki.payonstories.com/Killing_Stroke` + `/Mirror_Image` (both fetched
  live — the formula and the image counts are stated outright on those pages).
  **Side fix in the frontend:** `dps_valid:false` also zeroed `killDps`, which blanked
  **hits-to-kill** — but "how many casts to kill" is precisely what you want from a
  burst nuke. Those branches are a single deterministic hit with no crit or proc mix,
  so per-hit damage *is* the expected damage per cast; the panel now falls back to it
  and relabels the tile **"Casts to kill"**, while time-to-kill correctly stays blank
  (no rate, no honest duration). The DPS "—" now carries a tooltip saying why.

- **Cards are only counted in a slot they can compound into** (`gearBonusAggregator.js`,
  `SLOT_CARD_LOCS` + `cardFitsSlot`). The aggregator applied every card sitting in a
  `*_cardN` key regardless of the card's own `loc`, so a garment card in an armour slot
  paid out in full. The **editor was never the hole** — `SLOT_CARD_LOC` in `BuildEditor.tsx`
  and the `?loc=` filter on the item route already restrict the picker — but three paths
  bypass the picker entirely: share URLs (`z3_`), the jaludev importer, and direct API
  calls. So the guard belongs in the engine, next to the existing `ammoFitsWeapon` check.
  `left_hand` is resolved by what is HELD (an off-hand weapon takes `EQP_WEAPON`, a shield
  takes `EQP_SHIELD`); a card with no/empty `loc` fails open, which keeps the synthetic
  wildcard cards (`47xx`, every loc) usable in every slot as the custom card-mix UI needs.
  **This exposed three stale test fixtures** — the golden scenarios still slotted Pirate Skel
  and Wootan Fighter as accessory/armour cards after the earlier data fix moved them to
  headgear, and the Wanderer `isequipped` test had all four thief-set cards in the wrong
  slots. Those tests were only passing *because* the engine ignored `loc`. Fixtures corrected
  (cards hosted on a Hat 2221 / their real slots); the only golden movement is the host
  headgear's `def_` +2 — every damage number is unchanged, confirming the bonuses still
  apply from the correct slot.

- **Bonus-routing audit — several damage bonuses were parsed but not applied.**
  Diffed every `bonus`/`bonus2` type used in `item_db` against what
  `bonusDefinitions.js` actually routes, and checked table entries that were
  present but defined with no `field`/`mode` (silent no-ops). Fixed:
  `bNoSizeFix` (Drake Card — size penalty; new `no_sizefix` gear flag folded
  into the build), `bIgnoreMdefRace` (High Wizard Card — 100% non-boss MDEF
  ignore; new `dict_const` aggregator mode + `value` on `def()`),
  `bIgnoreDefRace` (40+ race "ignore DEF" cards — was a no-op, now
  `ignore_def_rate` at 100%), `bMatk` (flat gear MATK, ~150 items — was a no-op,
  now a `matk` gear field folded into `bonus_matk_flat`), `bCriticalAddRace`
  (+crit vs race — now consumed in `critChance`, `gearBonuses` threaded through),
  and `bAddDamageClass` (+% vs a specific mob id — had a duplicate effect-less
  definition overriding it; now routed and applied in `cardFix` via a new
  `target.mob_id`). Verified no remaining same-object duplicate keys in the
  bonus tables. Remaining unhandled `damage_type` flags (`IgnoreDefCards`,
  `NoDamage`, `SplitDamage`) are near-zero impact for single-monster targeting.
- **Offensive "Misc"-typed skills now selectable** — the skill picker's
  `damage_only` filter (`routes/data.ts`) kept only `attack_type` `Weapon`/`Magic`,
  but the skill DB tags every non-weapon/magic skill as `Misc` (buffs, masteries,
  songs, *and* delayed/indirect damage skills). That hid genuine offensive
  skills the engine already computes — e.g. Venom Splasher (`AS_SPLASHER`, PS
  ratio `500 + 50×lv + 30×PoisonReactLv`%) and Acid Terror. The filter now also
  keeps any skill the active server profile has a `weapon_ratios`/`magic_ratios`
  entry for, which is the precise "this server can actually calculate it" signal;
  vanilla (empty ratio tables) is unchanged. Verified end-to-end (Venom Splasher
  Lv10 → 1000% ratio → real damage).
- **Monster-family (RC2) "Bane" cards implemented** — real `bAddRace2` cards
  (Orc Lady, Goblin/Kobold Leader, Lava Golem, plus RC2_Guardian/RC2_Ninja
  cards) were parsed but silently dropped: there was no `bAddRace2` routing and
  no mob→family data anywhere in the port (Hercules/rAthena migrated it out of
  the DB files). Added end-to-end: `bAddRace2` → `add_race2` dict in
  `bonusDefinitions.js`; `add_race2: {}` in `createGearBonuses` and `race2: []`
  on targets in `models.js`; a new `db/mob_race2_db.json` (pre-re RC2 groups —
  Goblin/Kobold/Orc/Golem/Guardian/Ninja, recovered from rAthena's
  pre-migration `db/pre-re/mob_race2_db.txt`) with a cached reverse map in
  `dataLoader.getMonster` that attaches `target.race2`; and application in
  `cardFix.js` as its own multiplier, gated on the target's family. Verified
  end-to-end (Orc Lady card = +30% vs Orc-family mobs, 0% otherwise). Separate
  from the wildcard "Type"/`add_type` mix, which still applies unconditionally
  as a slotting simulation. Payon-Stories-custom mobs added to a family would
  need extra entries in the data file.
- **Weapon card wildcard "Type" category (`bAddRace2`)** — the weapon-card
  wildcard mix gained a fourth category, **Type**, for monster-family "Bane"
  cards (Orc / Goblin / Kobold / Golem-Bane, +30% physical damage). Added an
  `add_type` field to `createGearBonuses` (`models.js`), fed by the `Type_All`
  wildcard key in `playerStateBuilder.js`, and consumed as its own
  multiplicative `typeBonus` factor in `cardFix.js` (separate from
  race/ele/size). Applies to the selected target since the mix simulates
  "what card would I slot". Also fixed the wildcard aggregation dropping the
  mix on a weapon switch — it now iterates the equipped weapon's live slot
  count instead of a stale stored `wildcard_slots` copy.
- **Soft-DEF variance preserved through def-ratio / Investigate** — added
  `scaleFloorNumRange(pmf, numLo, numHi, step, denom)` to `pmf.js`;
  `defenseFix.js` now uses it for `MO_INVESTIGATE` (`isPdef2`) and
  `bDefRatioAtk` cards (`isPdef1`: Ice Pick / Frozen / Thanatos) so damage
  scaled by a high-VIT target's *random* soft DEF keeps its min–max range
  instead of collapsing to the average factor (e.g. Investigate vs a VIT 100
  target now reads ~5805–6870, not a flat ~6337). Low-VIT targets with no
  soft-DEF variance still resolve to a single value.
- **ASPD %-bonus stacking corrected** — percentage ASPD-rate bonuses
  (Two-Hand / One-Hand / Spear Quicken, Adrenaline, potion `bAspdRate`) were
  applied as two separate floored multiplications, undershooting the real
  value (+30% Quicken and +20% potion gave ×0.70×0.80 = ×0.56 instead of the
  additive ×0.50). `bonus_aspd_percent` is now folded into `scAspdRate` and
  the combined rate is applied once, matching pre-renewal behaviour (fixed
  ASPD reading a couple of points low on buffed builds — e.g. Two-Hand
  Quicken not moving ASPD at all on a Knight/Claymore build).
- **Provoke as a target debuff** — `SC_PROVOKE` (Lv 1–10) added to the target
  debuff panel, lowering the target's soft DEF so it takes more physical
  damage. URL-encoded alongside the build and kept independent of the
  player's own Auto Berserk / Provoke self-buff (turning on one no longer
  toggles the other).
- **PS Demon Bane (AL_DEMONBANE) rework** — Payon Stories buffs Demon Bane
  ([wiki](https://wiki.payonstories.com/Demon_Bane)) from vanilla `+3/lv` to
  `+5/lv`, keeping the `(BaseLv+1)/20` per-level base scaling, and adds a new
  `+4/lv` vs non-Undead/Demon targets. Implemented as a `mastery_ctx_overrides.AL_DEMONBANE`
  entry on the `PAYON_STORIES` profile: `lv × floor(5 + (BaseLv+1)/20)` vs
  Undead-element(9)/Demon-race (→ **100 at Lv10/base 99**, vs vanilla 80), else
  `lv × 4`. Verified end-to-end: Monk (Waghnak[4] + 4× Santa Poring vs Corruptor)
  auto-attack now matches in-game exactly (547 no-Signum / 640 Signum; was 509/603
  — the constant post-DEF gap of ~21 ATK × the +80% card multiplier). Also fixed
  the shared vanilla formula in `masteryFix.js` to floor the per-level multiplier
  like Hercules (`lv × floor(3 + (BaseLv+1)/20)` = 80, was `trunc(lv × (3 + BaseLv/20))`
  = 79) so the `standard` profile is correct too.
- **PS Signum Crucis (AL_CRUCIS) rework** — the target-debuff toggle was
  applying a flat −35% via `def_percent` (which wrongly scales both hard *and*
  soft DEF) and gating on `race === "Undead"`. Corrected to the PS values in
  `ps_skill_db.json` (id 32): a **hard-DEF-only** reduction of `10 + 4×lv`
  → **−50% at Lv10**, applied to `target.def_` in `routes/calculate.ts`, and
  gated on **Undead-element (idx 9) or Demon-race** (Undead is an element, not
  a race — Demon monsters of any element now qualify). Stacks with Provoke.
  Confirmed against [wiki.payonstories.com/Signum_Crucis](https://wiki.payonstories.com/Signum_Crucis)
  and this repo's `ps_skill_db.json`; the two disagree on the level curve (the
  wiki summary showed a 5-level 14→50 curve, `ps_skill_db.json` lists 10 levels
  as `10 + 4×lv`), so the in-repo data was treated as canonical — matches the
  engine's existing (previously dead) `SC_CRUCIS` formula in `targetUtils.js`.
  UI (`BuildEditor.tsx`): `signumApplicable` now checks element/race, and the
  label/tooltip read "−50% hard DEF (10 + 4×lv)". Toggle assumes Lv10.
- **PS Bleeding revamp** — purely data/item-layer changes; no new engine
  modifier code required. Six item script overrides in `ps_item_overrides.json`
  (Breeze Card ATK 5→8 / bleed 5%→2%; Hatii Claw bleed 2%→5%; Hakujin
  13014/13015 +8% bleed; Huuma Giant Wheel Shuriken 13301/13302 bleed removed).
  Breeze Card + Muka Card combo (+6% bleed on hit) added to
  `ps_item_combo_db.json`. `PS_BLEEDING_REVAMP` mechanic flag added to
  `serverProfiles.js` documenting the DOT mechanic change (5% maxHP / 0.5s for
  2.5s, can kill, 35s immunity, cannot inflict on targets ≥15 base levels higher
  than attacker) — the DOT itself is not modelled in the outgoing-damage
  calculator. Skill-side (Wounding Shot, Acid Terror) and mob-side (Skogul,
  Killer Mantis) bleed-chance changes are noted in the changelog but not
  modelled.

- **Dancer/Gypsy Whip equip fix** — `dataLoader.js` now runs a normalisation
  pass over the item DB that remaps the `job` array for any item whose
  `weapon_type` is `"Whip"` from `[19, 4020]` (Bard/Clown, which uses a
  `SEX_MALE` lock in the source data) to `[20, 4021]` (Dancer/Gypsy). Whips
  carry no gender restriction in the source data, so the vanilla DB's bitmask
  was wrong for this equipment class.

- **PS Monk rework — Triple Attack proc** — `MO_TRIPLEATTACK` procs on
  auto-attacks for Monk/Champion; proc rates level-indexed `[28,26,24,22,20]%`,
  Knuckle bonus `+0.2×lv% per 10 job levels`. `MO_TRIPLEATTACK_PS_BONUS`
  mechanic flag gates Fury-conditional crit: when SC_EXPLOSIONSPIRITS is active,
  the proc branch runs a separate crit branch at Fury's crit rate. Six-slot
  attack-definition model covers all crit/proc/miss combinations. `MO_TRIPLEATTACK`
  added to `DAMAGE_RELEVANT` + `ACTIVE_SKILL_TYPE_EXCEPTIONS` so it appears in
  the passive panel.
- **PS Hunter rework** — four offensive trap skills (`HT_LANDMINE`,
  `HT_BLASTMINE`, `HT_FREEZINGTRAP`, `HT_CLAYMORETRAP`) now calculate real
  damage for the `PAYON_STORIES` profile using the reworked INT/DEX-based
  formulas (divisors 45 and 70). Bypasses DEF; element fix, race/size card
  bonuses, `bSkillAtk` bonuses (Dory Card, Wolpertinger Card, Setting Dirk),
  and `bFinalAtk` all still apply. Card bonus values updated in
  `ps_item_manual.json`, `ps_item_overrides.json`, and `ps_item_db.json`.
- **PS Assassin/Thief rework** — katar second-hit proc (now in the
  battlePipeline and exposed as a breakdown branch), Enchant Poison passive
  damage bonus vs Poison-element targets, Envenom weapon-element override,
  dual-wield three-hit auto-attack model (Assassin/Assassin Cross with an
  off-hand weapon: 2×RH×`AS_RIGHT`_factor + LH×`AS_LEFT`_factor per swing),
  and a ×1.10 PS combined-damage bonus (`DUAL_WIELD_PS_DAMAGE_BONUS`) applied
  to the three-hit total — all gated behind `PAYON_STORIES` mechanic flags.
- **PS Crusader rework** (`PSRO_Crusader_Rework_2026.pdf`) — Reflect Shield PS
  formula (`floor(SoftDEF × (1 + 1.75 × HardDEF/100) × lv/10)`, DEF-ignoring,
  hit-checked, element/card-enhanced); DPS suppressed (`dps_valid: false`) since
  it triggers on enemy attack speed, not player ASPD. Armor element resolved via
  `resolveArmorElement` (handles Ghostring card etc.). Spear Quicken grants Hit/
  Flee instead of Crit (`SC_SPEARQUICKEN` in `PS_PASSIVE_OVERRIDES`). Magnum
  Break fire endow restricted to auto-attacks (`SM_MAGNUM_ENDOW_ATTACK_ONLY`
  flag). Stone Discus now only boosts Shield Boomerang (not Shield Charge).
- **PS Knight rework** (`Payon Stories Knight Patch (1).pdf`) — Sword Quickening
  CRIT: +1%/lv via `SC_TWOHANDQUICKEN.cri_per_lv: 10` in `PS_PASSIVE_OVERRIDES`.
  Spear Stab capped at level 5 via `skill_level_cap_overrides`. Blade Mastery
  covers 1H Sword: `mastery_prefer_fallback { SM_SWORD: "KN_TWOHANDMASTERY" }`
  routes 1H Sword mastery to Blade Mastery when the Knight has levels in it.
- **PS Rogue rework** (`Rogue_Patchnotes_PayonStories.pdf`) — Backstab ratio is
  `200+40×lv`% (240% @Lv1 → 600% @Lv10). The 2026-08-22 audit briefly changed this
  to `200+30×lv` on the PDF's wording ("reduced ... to 200%+30%*Skill_Level") and
  shipped 500% @Lv10 to players; the wiki's per-level table, `ps_skill_db` and the
  in-game tooltip all say 600%. Reverted 2026-08-27. Backstab
  Opportunity (+40% multiplicative) gated on `RG_BACKSTAP_OPPORTUNITY` mechanic
  flag and `support_buffs.backstab_opportunity`; UI checkbox in Skill panel
  (skill ID 212, PS server). Trick Arrow ratio corrected to 200% (2×100% hits).
  Vulture's Eye enables bow Double Attack (`RG_BOW_DOUBLE_ATTACK` flag;
  proc = `doubleRate × min(TF_DOUBLE_lv, AC_VULTURE_lv)`). Yser Card (ID 8236)
  now functional: `bSkillAtk` for RG_BACKSTAP/RG_RAID (+10% each) and +5 HIT.
  `bSkillAtk` bonuses are applied once, inside `calculateSkillRatio()` (a later
  fix removed a duplicate re-application in `_runBranch` that double-counted them).
- **PS Merchant / Blacksmith / Alchemist rework 2026-08-09** (`PayonStories Merchant`,
  `PayonStories Blacksmith`, `PayonStories Alchemist Rework`, `PayonStories Burning`, all
  dated 2026-08-09) — see per-class audit items 10 & 11 below for the full formula list.
  Implementation notes worth keeping in view:
  - `skill_level_cap_overrides` now **SETS** a skill's PS max level instead of only clamping
    it downward (`dataLoader._applySkillCap`). Cart Revolution 1→5, Crazy Uproar 1→4 and the
    Smith Weapon skills 3→4 all need it to raise; `BS_TWOHANDSWORD: 0` is how a removed skill
    disappears from the pickers. It is also applied in `getPassiveSkillsForJob` now, which
    previously trusted `ps_skill_db.json`'s scraped max and so could not see a post-scrape rework.
  - `mastery_prefer_fallback` values may be an **array** — first mastery the character has
    ranks in wins. Mace routes to `["MO_IRONHAND", "PS_MC_TOOLMASTERY"]` (Monk vs Merchant).
  - `passive_overrides` entries accept `weapon_types` (gate) and `matk_pct_per_lv`
    (Transmutation is the first passive granting %MATK; applied next to gear `bMatkRate`,
    before Amplify).
  - **PS-custom PASSIVES** now reach the picker: `ps_skill_desc_overrides.json` can ADD a
    constant the scrape doesn't know (that is how `PS_MC_TOOLMASTERY` exists at all), and
    `getPassiveSkillsForJob` appends any entry in its `PS_CUSTOM_PASSIVES` set whose
    `ps_custom_constants.json` job list matches. **Tool Mastery's id 2637 is provisional.**
  - **Card autocast on attack** (`_runCardAutocastBranches`, flag `PS_CARD_AUTOCAST_ON_ATTACK`):
    `gearBonuses.autocast_on_attack` was parsed but never consumed by any pipeline. It now
    produces a `proc_branches.card_autocast_<SKILL>` entry on **auto-attacks only**, priced
    through the same `_runBranch`/`_runMagicBranch` the player's own cast uses. Extending it to
    skill casts needs an attack-period model for the proc; deliberately left out for now.
  - **`itemScriptParser` fix**: `safeEvalInt`'s `compare()` returned a boolean `1` even when no
    comparison operator was present, so any arithmetic reaching it collapsed to 1. Hercules
    scripts embed comparisons inside arithmetic (`1+9*(getskilllv(X)==10)` = the cast level),
    which is exactly what the auto-Mammonite / auto-Bash cards need. It now returns the value
    when nothing was compared. (`evalArithmetic` still handles the comparison-free fast path.)
  - **New items** live in `ps_item_manual.json`; each carries a `_note` explaining the deviation
    (`_note` is stripped in `_applyPsItemLayers`, never reaching the item object). Veteran Axe
    reuses its real id **1384**; Whirling Hammer and Giant Pestle first sat in a reserved
    provisional 95xxx block because `tools.payonstories.com/api/pc/item` returned `No data` for
    both. **Both have since been re-keyed to their published ids — Whirling Hammer 8429**
    (in-game client tooltip, 2026-08-09) **and Giant Pestle 8430** (item API, 2026-08-10); the
    95xxx block is now empty (share links made before the re-key need the weapon re-picked).
    The API served PRE-rework text on 2026-08-09 for Veteran Axe (ATK 250 / req 80), FUEL Card
    (+30%), Pill Bug Card (+8%), Pirate Skel Card (Discount 5) and Flame Beetle Card (20%), so
    the patch was modeled from the rework PDFs ahead of the server deploy.
  - **API re-check 2026-08-10** (the day after the deploy — the API has caught up). Every
    reworked item now confirms what the PDFs gave us: Veteran Axe 1384 (ATK 155 / wlv 3 / req 60
    / 2 slots, +5·+4·+1% per mastered Smith Weapon skill, doubled at base DEX & LUK 80+),
    Crescent Scythe 1466 + slotted **1476** (0.1% crit leech PER REFINE — the GM's follow-up
    correction, not the flat 0.1% of the original notes), Whirling Hammer 8429 (ATK 190 / req 60
    / Blacksmith / +1% Cart Revolution per refine), Giant Pestle 8430 (Mace, ATK 100, wlv 3,
    req 58, Alchemist, +3/+12 ATK per Pharmacy level), Wootan Fighter 4261 (Magnum Break effect
    → 30%), Pirate Skel 4073 (5% auto-Mammonite, Lv10 for Blacksmiths), FUEL 90007 (+10% both
    skills, Flee +5), Pill Bug 90014 (+10% Cart Revolution). **One thing the PDFs did not carry:**
    Flame Beetle Card 8237's new combo line — see below.
  - **Pirate Skel + Flame Beetle Card combo** (`ps_item_combo_db.json`, surfaced by the
    2026-08-10 API re-check): *"Autocast Mammonite does not consume zeny and is unaffected by
    Zeny Pincher."* That IS a damage term here, because PS' Zeny Pincher halves Mammonite's
    per-level ratio term — so with both cards the proc keeps **600% at Lv10 instead of 350%**.
    Modeled as the PS-custom `bAutoMammoniteNoZeny` (→ `gear_bonuses.auto_mammonite_no_zeny`),
    which `_runCardAutocastBranches` turns into a `MC_MAMMONITE_zeny_exempt` skill_param on the
    PROC's build only; a manual Mammonite on the same character is still pinched. Flame Beetle's
    own 50% zero-zeny chance remains unmodeled (zeny economy, no damage surface).
- **Skill cooldowns (2026-08-10)** — pre-renewal Hercules has none, so the engine had none:
  `skillTiming` returned `max(after-cast delay, 100 ms)` and a skill with a documented cooldown
  span the 100 ms floor instead. PS documents them on the wiki ("Cast Delay : Global Cooldown and
  0.3s Cooldown"), and the bundled `ps_skill_db.json` predates that text — every entry still reads
  `"cast_delay": "Global Cooldown"` with no number. So they live in their own scraped file,
  `data/ps/ps_skill_cooldowns.json`, rebuilt by `scripts/scrape-ps-cooldowns.mjs` (re-run after a
  patch; it resolves page titles against the wiki's own `list=allpages` index because PS names and
  page names differ — "Thunder Storm" is filed under "Thunderstorm", NJ_ISSEN is "Killing Strike"
  in the DB and "Killing Stroke" on the wiki).
  - `profile.skill_cooldown_ms` holds them; `skillTiming` takes **max(after-cast delay, cooldown)**
    because a cooldown blocks only that skill while the delay blocks every skill — and DPS models
    spamming one skill. Applied AFTER the reduction block: a cooldown is fixed, so Bragi, delayrate
    gear and `after_cast_delay_reduction_pct` never shorten it (Acid Terror's page says
    "unreducable" outright).
  - Found on the first sweep of the 140 damage skills: **Demonstration 5 s, Charge Attack 3 s,
    Musical Strike 0.3 s, Throw Arrow 0.3 s, Acid Terror 0.22 s.** 37 skills have no wiki page at
    all (mostly transcendent), so those keep vanilla timing until PS documents them.
  - DPS impact where it binds: Demonstration **−85%**, Charge Attack **−80%**, Throw Arrow −19%,
    Musical Strike −5%. Acid Terror is unaffected — its 0.22 s cooldown is shorter than its cast.
  - **`bSkillCooldown`** (new PS-custom bonus, milliseconds, negative to reduce) lets gear move a
    cooldown; `gearBonuses.skill_cooldown` is added to the profile value, floored at 0. FUEL Card
    uses it for its −2 s on Demonstration (5 s → 3 s, which is +77% DPS for that build). This is
    the first bonus that touches a cooldown rather than a delay — do not reuse `bDelayrate`, which
    is a percentage on the after-cast delay and is reducible.
- **PS 2026-08-09 patch notes** (the GM announcement — carries changes the four rework PDFs
  do NOT mention; the PDFs are Merchant/Blacksmith/Alchemist only). Verified line by line:
  - **Crusader — Reflect Shield new formula**: `SkillLevel × ((SoftDef/2) + ⌊VIT/10⌋²) ×
    (100 + 2×Def) / 1000`, replacing the earlier PS rework's `SoftDEF × (1 + 1.75×HardDEF/100)
    × lv/10`. VIT is now QUADRATIC, which changes the stat priority for the skill entirely.
    Written with a single final floor (the notes floor only the VIT/10 term); ≤1 damage apart
    from flooring each step. Verified by hand: VIT 87 / SoftDEF 87 / HardDEF 0 / Lv5 →
    5 × (43.5 + 64) × 100/1000 = 53.75 → 53.
  - **Swordsman — Magnum Break's lingering effect now covers Magnum Break as well as auto
    attacks.** Acting on this exposed two problems. (1) The effect **was never modeled at
    all** — Hercules implements it as `SC_SUB_WEAPONPROPERTY` (skill.c SM_MAGNUM:
    `sc_start4(..., 3 /* Ele_Fire */, 20, ...)`), and pre-re battle.c adds it at the END of
    `battle_calc_elefix`: `temp = calc_base_damage2(rhw) × val2/100; damage += attr_fix(temp,
    Fire)`. So it is an extra chunk built from a fresh NORMAL-ATTACK base damage (not the
    skill's ratio'd damage) that lands AFTER defenseFix and therefore bypasses DEF. Now
    implemented at exactly that position in `_runBranch`, behind an
    `active_buffs.SC_SUB_WEAPONPROPERTY` toggle. (2) `SM_MAGNUM_ENDOW_ATTACK_ONLY` was a
    **no-op**: it rewrote `build.weapon_element` in `calculate()`, but the endow is already
    baked into the resolved `weapon` back in `resolvePlayerState`, so it changed nothing —
    and it keyed off `support_buffs.weapon_endow_sc`, which is the SAGE endow / Aspersio
    selector, not Magnum Break's buff (a Sage's Endow legitimately does apply to skills). The
    flag now scopes the real lingering-fire component instead: auto attacks + SM_MAGNUM.
  - **Wootan Fighter Card 20% → 30%** lingering effect: new PS-specific `bMagnumLinger`
    bonus, `assign` mode so two copies cap at 30 rather than stacking to 40.
  - **Skeleton Pirate Card** (the notes' name for Pirate Skel Card): the Lv10 auto-Mammonite
    upgrade is tagged `[Blacksmith]` in BOTH the PDF and the notes, so it is gated on JOB
    (`Class==10 || Class==4011`), not on the skill level alone — a Merchant or Alchemist can
    also master Mammonite and would otherwise wrongly proc Lv10.
  - **Crescent Scythe**: the announcement says a flat "0.1% of the damage", but the GM's own
    follow-up explicitly corrects it to **0.1% PER REFINE** ("I blame whoever told me to put
    that in the patch notes"). The follow-up wins; implemented per refine.
  - **Flame Beetle Card 20% → 50%** zero-zeny Mammonite chance: zeny economy, no damage term.
  - **Fruit Mix removed**: it exists in the item DB (12063 / 14565, a +3 DEX food) but is not
    reachable from any picker — the equipment pickers query IT_WEAPON/IT_ARMOR/IT_CARD and the
    consumables panel is a fixed list. No calculator surface, so nothing to hide.
  - **Freebreeze additions**: Frostfire Violin (8353) and Gangster Scarf (5361) already exist
    with correct scripts — these were availability changes (weapon box / shard shop), not item
    changes. The costumes and Ardent Helm are cosmetic (no combat stats). Antiquarian is an NPC.
  - **No calculator surface**: Gatling Fever's toggle removal (modeled as a buff either way),
    Setting Dirk's movement-buff fix, Reflect Shield gaining autocast/Hunter Fly leech
    (neither is a damage-formula term), reflect delay removal, monster/skill-unit interval
    changes, `@mi` Hit/Flee display fix, quest fixes, `@goal`.
- **PS 2026-08-09 GM follow-up notes** (posted after the rework PDFs) — triaged:
  - **Crescent Scythe (1466) and its slotted variant (1476)**: crit lifesteal, **0.1% of the
    damage dealt PER REFINE**, not a flat 0.1% (the GM corrected their own patch note). Modeled
    via a new PS-specific `bCritHeal` bonus read as PER MILLE, so the script is literally
    `bonus bCritHeal,getrefine()`. Computed on the main crit branch only
    (`crit.crit_heal`) and deliberately kept out of `avg_damage`/DPS — it is HP returned, not
    damage. The dual-wield off-hand and katar second hits are separate rolls it doesn't price.
  - **Ice Titan Card DEF now applies while under attack** (previously suppressed by the
    Overcrowding penalty): **no code change needed, and the note confirms current behaviour.**
    This calculator does not model Overcrowding (a 23+-enemy DEF penalty; it appears only in a
    PS skill description), so gear DEF was already treated as always-on. Ice Titan's +10 DEF is
    an `autobonus2`, i.e. a proc, so it still only shows under the "always proc" toggle — that
    is about proc modeling, not about Overcrowding.
  - **Skeleton Pirate respawn timers cut to 45–60 s**: no calculator surface. Spawn/respawn
    timers are not part of the bundled mob data and nothing in the UI reports them. Relevant
    only as farming context for the reworked Pirate Skel Card.
  - **Whirling Hammer is obtainable in-game via a Blacksmith quest**: now keyed by its REAL id
    **8429**, read off the in-game client tooltip (the public item API still returns `No data`,
    so the client is the authoritative source here — as it will be for anything else that ships
    before the API catches up). The client **disagrees with the rework PDF on two points** and
    wins: **Level Requirement 60** (PDF said 70) and **Jobs: Blacksmith** → `[10, 4011]` (the
    PDF gave no job restriction, so it had been modeled as all Merchant classes). ATK 190 /
    weight 350 / weapon level 4 / 1 slot / `Whirling_Hammer` / +1% Cart Revolution per refine
    all match the PDF. Giant Pestle followed on 2026-08-10, re-keyed from the provisional 95002
    to its published id **8430** once the item API listed it (all of its stats matched).
- Magic pipeline (#1 above moved to "Fully ported").
- Card slots on equipment — up to 4 per item, read from `item.slots`,
  written to `equipped["<slot>_cardN"]`, already consumed by
  `gearBonusAggregator.js` with no engine changes needed.
- Equipment search now filters by `loc` (was returning all `IT_ARMOR`
  items for every armor slot); `left_hand` searches both shields and
  off-hand weapons.
- Passive skill panel, filtered to an explicit allowlist of masteries that
  actually move ATK/MATK/hit/crit/ASPD (see `dataLoader.js#getPassiveSkillsForJob`).
- Grand Cross (`CR_GRANDCROSS`) — see the caveat in the table above; formula
  not verified against Hercules source, re-derive if that becomes possible.
- `BF_WEAPON_RATIOS` (vanilla table in `skillRatio.js`) filled out from 29
  to its full 52 entries, count-verified against upstream, spot-checked
  `GS_BULLSEYE`'s conditional race bonus end-to-end.
- `incoming_physical_pipeline.py` / `incoming_magic_pipeline.py` ported as
  `engine/calculators/incomingPipeline.js` (`calculateIncomingPhysicalDamage`
  / `calculateIncomingMagicDamage`), exposed via `POST /api/calculate/incoming`
  (`{ build, target: { mob_id }, direction: "physical"|"magic", opts }`).
  Reuses `buildManager.playerBuildToTarget` (was ported but never called —
  found and fixed a bug in it: player race was `"DemiHuman"`, every race
  lookup table elsewhere in this engine uses the hyphenated `"Demi-Human"`)
  and `cardFix.js`'s existing incoming-physical/magic functions. Includes
  the Lex Aeterna ×2 multiplier (`SC_LEXAETERNA`). Verified end-to-end
  against a real mob (Scorpion, id 1001) for both directions, and confirmed
  Lex Aeterna exactly doubles the result. **Frontend UI shipped** (2026-06-27)
  as the **Survivability panel** (`components/SurvivabilityView.tsx`): damage
  taken through DEF/MDEF and reduction gear, hits-to-down, effective HP, damage
  mitigated, dodge chance, and the FLEE needed for the 95% cap, plus the mob's
  damage-dealing cast skills (element/type only — PS-tuned skill power isn't
  shown). A monster's basic melee is priced as Neutral.

## Server-trace testing (2026-08-27)

`goldens.json` records what this engine produced last time. It proves we have not changed;
it cannot prove we are right, because it is generated from the code it checks — every wrong
number this project has shipped was a green golden at the time. It also only pins the FINAL
number.

`test/server-traces.json` + `server-traces.test.js` compare our pipeline **stage by stage**
against debug output from the live server. The first fixture is why it exists: on Laila
Braveheart's Soul Bullet build our total is 4.5% from the server's, while every intermediate
stage is ~46% out — an inflated base damage cancelling a multiplier we do not model. A
final-number check sails straight through that, and did, until a player noticed.

    post ratio (3-hit total)   server    4323   ours    6315   +46.1%
    post defense               server    3202   ours    4694   +46.6%
    post madness (+30%)        server    4162   ours    6102   +46.6%
    post element fix           server    7327   ours   10722   +46.3%
    pre cardfix                server   10346   ours   10812    +4.5%

Every stage is pinned to its current value, divergent or not, so drift always fails; a stage
marked `diverges` that starts matching also fails, telling you to promote it. Divergences must
carry a reason. Do not delete a stage to get green.

**Open, pending data from Alardun** (the trace's `raw_log` lists exactly what is missing):
the `(pre ratio)` line was truncated, everything after `(pre cardfix)` is unrecorded, and one
label is misread (two lines both read "post elefix"). The decisive one is **a second trace at
0 coins**: the server multiplies by ~1.412 between element fix and cardfix, we model coins as
`+3 ATK × div` (+0.8%), and if that step is the coin bonus then coins are a ~40% multiplier —
which would also explain the earlier "coins don't add damage" report.

## Ratios pinned on PDF authority alone (2026-08-27)

Back Stab shipped at 500% @Lv10 for five days because the 2026-08-22 audit applied
one rule — "a rework PDF beats the wiki and beats ps_skill_db" — to a case where it
gave the wrong answer, and then pinned the result with a passing test whose own
message read "(wiki says 600)". The conflict was recorded and mis-resolved, not
missed. A rework PDF states INTENT; it is not evidence of what shipped.

**Corrected rule.** Where a rework PDF disagrees with a full per-level wiki table
AND the scraped `ps_skill_db` agrees with that table, the table wins. Two sources
describing the live server outrank one describing a plan.

**Still decided the old way — confirm in-game before trusting.** Each was pinned on
the PDF against a disagreeing wiki, i.e. the exact pattern that produced the Back
Stab bug. None has been checked against the live server.

| Skill | Ours (PDF) | Wiki | ps_skill_db | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AM_ACIDTERROR` | 600% @Lv5 | 500% | **500%** | **Highest** — wiki and the scraped DB agree with each other and against us, exactly as they did for Back Stab |
| `KN_SPEARSTAB` | 300% @Lv5 | 100+20×lv | — | Wiki may simply be pre-rework |
| `KN_BOWLINGBASH` | 400% @Lv10 | 100+30×lv | 100+40×lv | Three-way disagreement; ours matches neither |

`MO_COMBOFINISH` also disagrees with the wiki at Lv1–2 only (ours 345/435, wiki
340/425; `ps_skill_db` agrees with us) — likely a stale wiki row, low impact.

**Audit tooling gaps found while investigating** (`tools/audit/audit_skills.py`,
all fixed 2026-08-27 except the last):

- A full run crashed twice: `KeyError` on an ALIAS naming a page absent from the
  snapshot, and `UnicodeEncodeError` whenever stdout was redirected on Windows.
  Nobody could complete a full audit; only per-skill runs worked.
- The wikitable parser could not read newline-style cells (`!Level` on its own
  line), damage headers carrying a qualifier (`base ATK (%)`), or values whose
  `%` lives in the header. Back Stab's table hit all three and scored `n/a`.
- **Empty overlap rendered as `MATCH`.** Acid Terror parsed to junk level keys
  (`{1180: 3.0, 2260: 6.0, …}`); the intersection with our levels was empty, the
  diff list came back empty, and the report printed a confident `MATCH` having
  compared nothing. Now `NO-OVERLAP`.
- Unreadable tables printed `n/a`, indistinguishable from "page has no table".
  Now `UNPARSED`, and the run ends with an explicit count of skills that were
  **not actually checked**.
- **Open:** 20 skills still report `UNPARSED` — GS_*, NJ_*, KN_AUTOCOUNTER,
  MG_SOULSTRIKE, PR_MAGNUS, WZ_FIREPILLAR and others. Their wiki tables use
  layouts the parser still cannot read, so those ratios remain unverified against
  the wiki. Run `python tools/audit/audit_skills.py` for the current list.

## Payon Stories per-class skill audit (against the PS wiki)

The Gunslinger audit (2026-07-07, see the CHANGELOG) cross-checked every PS-reworked
GS skill against [wiki.payonstories.com](https://wiki.payonstories.com) and turned up
several real damage bugs. **This pass has now been completed for all 14 class groups
below** (each verified with a DEF-bearing target, against the class's PS rework PDF where
one exists, else the wiki) — every item is marked ✅ done.
Classes are **sequenced by how many PS-custom overrides they carry** (weapon/magic
ratios, `passive_overrides`, `rate_bonuses`, `weapon_hit_counts`, `mastery_ctx_overrides`,
mechanic flags, …) — more custom changes ⇒ higher chance of a mismatch. Counts in
brackets are the number of PS-custom entries found across those tables.

**Bug classes to check for each skill** (every one of these was hit at least once in the GS pass):
- skill ratio wrong vs the wiki (per-level %, base, or race/size-conditional);
- hit count wrong or missing — single-hit in the vanilla DB but multi-hit on PS
  (e.g. Soul Bullet ×3), or a variable-hit spray (e.g. Desperado 1–10 range);
- passive HIT / ASPD / ATK per level undercounted (e.g. Single Action +4/lv, not +2/lv);
- stat-conversion or weapon-conditional passive not modelled (e.g. Dust +1 ATK/STR with a Shotgun);
- buff mechanic wrong — flat BATK where PS uses a % damage bonus (check `rate_bonuses`);
- an active skill's mastery bonus unreachable because the skill isn't surfaced in the passive
  panel (`DAMAGE_RELEVANT` / `ACTIVE_SKILL_TYPE_EXCEPTIONS` in `dataLoader.js`);
- a skill **removed** on PS still offered (e.g. Increasing Accuracy → gate behind a mechanic flag);
- gear bonuses parsed but dropped (see the bonus-routing audit under "Done this pass").

**Sequence (most PS-custom changes first):**

1. **Gunslinger [16]** — ✅ done. Fixed: Single Action HIT +4/lv, Soul Bullet ×3, Desperado 1–10
   range, Tranq Shot (Bull's Eye) Demi/Brute gate, Increasing Accuracy removed. Confirmed correct:
   Rapid Shower, Gatling Fever (+40% via `rate_bonuses`), Barrage/Madness Canceller (+30%), Wounding
   Shot, Ground Drift, Full Buster, Spread Attack, Triple Action, Chain Action, Snake Eye.
2. **Mage / Wizard / Sage [14]** — ✅ done (verified against the Sage Rework and Wizard/High-Wizard
   PDFs). Fixed: HW_NAPALMVULCAN (flat 100% MATK/hit + Shadow/Dark element + 50% MDEF ignore all
   levels), MG_SOULSTRIKE (flat 100%/hit base; +5%×lv vs-Undead bonus + 50% MDEF-ignore gated on
   lv10 both kept; fixed a vs-Undead crash), WZ_METEOR (flat 100%/hit). Confirmed correct:
   WZ_FROSTNOVA (175+15×lv, +10×FrostDiver, max 5), WZ_VERMILION (200×lv = 2000% @10),
   WZ_SIGHTRASHER (100+75×lv, max 5), WZ_FIREPILLAR (70+2×FireWall per hit × (2+2×lv) hits, +50%
   MDEF ignore, max 5), WZ_EARTHSPIKE / WZ_HEAVENDRIVE (140%/level), MG_FIREBALL (70→340%),
   WZ_AMPLIFYMAGICPOWER (10–50%, max 5), SA_ADVANCEDBOOK (max 5, Atk/ASPD). Not modeled:
   HW_GRAVITATION (fixed build-independent DoT, 400–1200/sec — nothing to compute).
3. **Thief / Assassin [12]** — ✅ done (verified against the Assassin Rework doc). Fixed: Enchant
   Poison / Venom Dust capped at level 5 (Enchant Poison's passive +2%/lv vs Poison-element monsters
   was reaching +20% instead of +10%). Confirmed correct: AS_SONICBLOW (500+40×lv = 900% @10) incl.
   the new crit rules (crit-eligible, Katar ×2 crit chance, crit bypasses DEF, excluded from Katar
   Mastery's +50% crit dmg — verified vs a DEF-100 target), AS_GRIMTOOTH crit, Katar offhand 2nd hit
   (21+4×KatarMastery = 61% @10), Envenom weapon element (TF_POISON_USES_WEAPON_ELEMENT), AS_SPLASHER
   (500+50×lv, max 10), AS_KATAR mastery (+4 ATK/lv, +50% crit dmg @10), Sonic Blow delay
   2000−(4×agi+2×dex), crit-shield removal (PS_CRIT_SHIELD_DISABLED). Added as toggles: Venom Dust
   Mailbreaker debuff (+10% phys & magic damage taken, works on MVP/boss) and the Cloak initiative
   opener (breaking Cloak Lv3+ → auto-attack ×2 / Sonic Blow +10%, per-hit only). Fully modeled.
4. **Rogue / Stalker [7]** — ✅ audited (Rogue Patchnotes PDF, with-DEF). Confirmed correct:
   RG_BACKSTAP (200+40×lv — 600% @Lv10; +40% Opportunity via the `backstab_opportunity` toggle; DEF applies;
   auto-hit / IgnoreFlee), RG_RAID (600% @lv5; DEF applies), Yser Card (+10% Raid & Backstab, +5
   HIT), Vulture's Eye enabling bow Double Attack (proc = min(TF_DOUBLE, AC_VULTURE)). **Blocked:**
   Trick Arrow (PS_RG_TRICKARROW, 200% / 2 hits) and Quick Step (PS_RG_QUICKSTEP, 10%) are now
   resolvable — `getSkill`/`getAllSkills` fall back to `_psCustomBattleSkills()` (battle fields added
   to `ps_skill_db.json`), so both are selectable and compute (DEF applies). Only Holy Strike
   (PS_PR_HOLYSTRIKE) remains unsurfaced — a passive melee proc with a mismatched job array
   ([7, 4008] = Knight/LK) that needs its own review.
   **Plagiarism (2026-08-11):** a Rogue/Stalker build now carries the ONE copied skill in
   `flags.plagiarism` (`{name, level}`); `playerStateBuilder` folds it into `mastery_levels` after
   the job filter, gated on `profile.plagiarism_jobs` + `plagiarism_copyable` (the wiki's copyable
   list, in `serverProfiles.js`) and clamped to the skill's PS max rank. That is what makes a copied
   **Triple Attack** proc on auto-attacks — the only copyable skill the engine reads passively;
   everything else was already castable from the (job-unfiltered) skill picker. Reported by a player
   who had no way to record a copy without setting it as the damage skill. Open: the MvP-only ranks
   the wiki documents (Intimidate 10 off Samurai Spectre, Water Ball 6/10 off Drake/Ktullanux) exceed
   the skill DB's max and are clamped away — the picker has no notion of an above-max rank.
5. **Swordsman / Knight [6]** — ✅ done (Knight Patch PDF + wiki, with-DEF). Fixed: **Blade Mastery**
   (SM_TWOHAND, key SM_TWOHANDSWORD) now covers 1H swords — the fallback pointed at a non-existent
   `KN_TWOHANDMASTERY`, so 1H-sword Knights got no mastery ATK; **Counter Attack** always-crits (its
   id was hard-coded 8 = SM_ENDURE; real id 61); **Bowling Bash** scales 100+30×lv (was flat 400%,
   only right at Lv10). Confirmed correct: Counter Attack 200%, Spear Stab 100+40×lv (max 5), Sword
   Quickening (+1% crit/lv, 1H-sword 1/3 ASPD partial), Brandish Spear distance formula, Spear
   Mastery [5,7]. Non-damage rework items (Living Sword SP-free casts, Charge Attack timing) are out
   of a damage calculator's scope.
6. **Monk / Champion [6]** — ✅ done (Monk Rework PDF, with-DEF). All damage-relevant items already
   correct, no code changes: Triple Attack (100+40×lv, max 5; crits under Critical Explosion via the
   `taCritProc` path / MO_TRIPLEATTACK_PS_BONUS), Chain Combo (200+60×lv = 260→500%), Combo Finish
   (255+90×lv = 345→705%), Martial Arts/Iron Hand (MO_IRONHAND +5 ATK/lv +2 FLEE/lv, covers Fist and
   Mace via the PR_MACEMASTERY→MO_IRONHAND fallback), Asura Strike SP rework (consumes 20%×lv×MaxSP).
   **Corrected 2026-07-14** (against the PSRO Monk Rework 2026 PDF p.3 + wiki.payonstories.com/Asura_Strike):
   Asura's flat bonus is a **constant 1000 at all ranks** (was the vanilla `250+150×lv` = 400→1000), and
   PS Asura **does NOT ignore DEF** — it takes normal hard+soft DEF (vanilla flags it IgnoreDefense).
   Wired via the `MO_EXTREMITYFIST_NK_NORMAL_DEF` flag. Critical Explosion/Fury (17.5+2.5×lv crit =
   20→30% @Lv5), Demon Bane. **Open**: spirit-sphere ATK bonus (+3 ATK/sphere, standard pre-re Monk
   mechanic) is unmodelled — the PS wiki's Asura page doesn't restate it, so it needs confirmation +
   a spirit-sphere input before wiring. Other non-damage items (Absorb Spirits / Spirits Recovery SP,
   combo-ready buffs, Steel Body overcrowding, Ki skills, card sphere-refunds) are out of scope.
7. **Acolyte / Priest [6]** — ✅ done. Fixed: AL_HOLYLIGHT (flat 250% MATK + Cookie card +20% on
   PS, **plus the LUK% chance to deal +60% damage** — modeled as a pmf mixture so avg/range fold in
   the proc), PR_TURNUNDEAD (real fixed-damage formula (BaseLv+INT+SkillLv×10)×3×(1+LUK×3/200), Holy,
   ignores DEF/cards — was wrongly computed as 100% MATK; **now also displays the instant-kill
   success chance** [20×SkillLv + 3×LUK + INT + BaseLv + (1−HP/MaxHP)×200]/10 %, halved if base INT
   < 40, and folds it into Casts/Time to kill). Re-audited against the Acolyte/Priest
   rework PDF: fixed **Holy Strike** (PS_PR_HOLYSTRIKE — corrected its job from Knight [7,4008] to
   Priest [8,4009] and surfaced it via the PS-custom loader; 101+STR+BaseLevel% ATK Holy proc) and
   **Magnus Exorcismus** (full damage now also vs Ghost element + Undead race, not just Undead
   element + Demon race). Confirmed correct: Demon Bane, Mace Mastery (+expanded weapons), Turn
   Undead damage (rework only changed the *success* formula, not the fail-damage). Minor open item:
   Signum Crucis DEF cut is a flat 50% toggle (the rework levels it −14/−23/−32/−41/−50% at Lv1–5;
   50% = max is correct, but it doesn't scale by level).
8. **Crusader / Paladin [5]** — ✅ done (Crusader Rework PDF, with-DEF). Confirmed correct: Holy Cross
   (300+25×lv), Shield Boomerang (100+40×lv), Shield Charge (200+20×lv, NK ignore flee), Reflect
   Shield (SoftDEF×(1+1.75×HardDEF/100)×lv/10, ignores target DEF, hit roll), Spear Quicken (no crit;
   +1 HIT/lv, +1 FLEE/lv), Grand Cross (masteries apply; the SP/pushback changes aren't damage),
   Magnum Break semi-endow (attack-only). **Fixed:** Stone Discus (+5%/refine Shield Boomerang only,
   was +3% to Boomerang+Charge) and — surfaced by it — a broad **item-script arithmetic bug**
   (`getrefine()*N` and any arithmetic bonus value was capped at +1; now evaluated properly, fixing
   every refine-scaling item bonus). Providence's rework is defensive (MDEF, def-penalty) — out of scope.
9. **Ninja [5]** — ✅ done (PS wiki, with-DEF). Confirmed correct: Huuma (200+150×lv = 350→950%),
   Hyousensou (85% MATK/hit × 3–12 hits), Kasumikiri (375% @Lv10 base, ×1.4 while Hiding = 525%),
   Kirikage (Hiding 100/200/400/600/800; Not-Hiding 100/190/280/360/450 − 10×distance; +Crit via
   Shadow's Within), Raigeki Sai (150+60×lv = 210→450%). **Fixed:** Bakuenryu (300→900% = 150+150×lv;
   was a flat 300% from the DB fallback) and **NJ_ISSEN (Killing Stroke)** — implemented its fixed
   HP-sacrifice formula (STR×40 + HP×8%×lv, Neutral, auto-hit, DEF+cards apply) via a dedicated
   `_runKillingStrokeBranch`; was computing a flat 100% ATK. **Mirror Image's +10–30% is now
   modeled too** (see "Done this pass"), which retires the upstream `NJ_ISSEN_MIRROR_BONUS` flag.
   Ninja Aura (SC_NJ_NEN) was already a buff entry and its +2 STR/lv feeds the ×40 STR term.
10. **Alchemist / Creator [3]** — ✅ done (PS wiki, with-DEF), **re-audited 2026-08-09 against
    `PayonStories Alchemist Rework 2026-08-09.pdf`**. Acid Demonstration unchanged (200+40×lv =
    240→400%, weapon-ATK-based with size penalty, DEF applies, ignores %-cards but +ATK cards
    apply). **Changed by the rework:** Acid Terror is now `(100+100×lv)%` = 200→**600%** at its
    rank-5 max (was 100+80×lv = 180→500%); **Axe Mastery became Transmutation** — no flat ATK at
    all, instead +1% ASPD **and +1% MATK** per level while wielding an Axe **or a Sword** (this is
    why `passive_overrides.AM_AXEMASTERY` carries `aspd_pct_per_lv`/`matk_pct_per_lv`/`weapon_types`
    instead of `atk_per_lv`, and why its old `lv10_rate` ASPD entry was dropped); Chemical
    Protections cap at rank 3. **FUEL Card** cut to +10% on both skills (was +30%). **New item:**
    Giant Pestle (1H Mace, ATK 100, Alchemist-only, +3/+12 ATK per Pharmacy level at base DEX &
    LUK 60+/80+). FUEL's **−2 s Demonstration cooldown IS modeled** as of 2026-08-10 (see the
    cooldown section below). **Not modeled (no damage surface):** Demonstration's SP cost 14→20
    (the calc models no SP costs); Bio Cannibalize's
    plant INT/AGI/HIT retune, Learning Potion's potion-conservation chance, the Potion Pitcher
    effect table, Tengu Card, Plant Bottle (summons/support); Remote Detonator itself — it is the
    *applier* of Burning, which IS modeled as a target debuff (see below).
11. **Merchant / Whitesmith [3]** — ✅ done (PS wiki, with-DEF), **re-audited 2026-08-09 against
    `PayonStories Merchant 2026-08-09.pdf` + `PayonStories Blacksmith 2026-08-09.pdf`**. Over Thrust
    / Power-Thrust unchanged (+5%/lv ATK to caster AND party, additive on the skill multiplier).
    Cart Termination still isn't a PS skill. **Changed by the rework:** **Cart Revolution** is a
    5-rank tree skill at `50×lv%` (50→250%; the old flat 250% was right only at max rank) and deals
    full damage regardless of cart weight; **Zeny Pincher** halves only the per-level term —
    `100+25×lv` = 350% at Lv10, replacing the old ×0.4-of-the-whole-ratio model (240%) — and is now
    reachable as the `SC_PS_ZENYPINCHER` self-buff toggle (before this it was an unreachable
    `skill_param` no UI ever set); **Tool Mastery** (new, `PS_MC_TOOLMASTERY`) gives +4 ATK/lv with
    Axes and Maces and is routed via `mastery_prefer_fallback` so it wins over the now-ATK-less Axe
    Mastery and over the Priest's Mace Mastery; **Crazy Uproar** is 4 ranks giving +1 STR/+1 VIT per
    level and 3×lv (self) / 2×lv (party) soft DEF; **Adrenaline Rush** covers every melee weapon at
    30%/20% (Axe·Mace, self/party) and 20%/10% (other melee) — the previous code passed the raw buff
    VALUE (the UI sent `2`) straight in as a per-mille amotion cut, so the buff was worth 0.2% ASPD;
    **Smith Weapon** skills master at rank 4 with Smith Two-Handed Sword folded into Smith Sword.
    **Cards:** Pill Bug +10% Cart Revolution (was 8%); Pirate Skel Card became a 5% auto-Mammonite
    (Lv10 once mastered), which drove the new generic card-autocast proc branch. **New items:**
    Veteran Axe [2] retuned (ATK 155, level 60, scaling per MASTERED Smith Weapon skill, doubled at
    base DEX & LUK 80+), Whirling Hammer [1] (2H Mace, ATK 190, +1% Cart Revolution per refine).
    **Not modeled (no damage surface):** Barter (the merged Discount/Overcharge — zeny economy),
    Pushcart's movement speed (rank cap applied anyway), Hilt Binding no longer extending buff
    durations (durations aren't modeled), Flame Beetle Card's own 50% zero-zeny chance and
    Mammonite's zeny cost, Sasquatch / Grizzly card status procs (freeze/blind chances).
    (Flame Beetle's *combo* with Pirate Skel Card IS modeled — it exempts the autocast from
    Zeny Pincher, which is a ratio term; see the 2026-08-10 API re-check above.)

    **New cross-class mechanic — Burning** (`PayonStories Burning 2026-08-09.pdf`): a 5-second
    debuff stacking to 5, each stack −2 hard MDEF and 60 Fire MAGIC damage/second, refreshed (not
    re-timed per stack) on reapplication. The MDEF cut is applied as a target mod
    (`target_mods.burning`, profile constants in `PAYON_STORIES.burning`) so it feeds the magic
    branch like any other MDEF change. The tick itself is surfaced in the UI as a raw
    60×stacks/second figure **explicitly labelled as pre-mitigation** — it is Fire magic damage
    subject to the target's Fire resist / MDEF / armour element, and it is the debuff's damage
    rather than part of the player's hit, so pricing it inside the attack breakdown would be
    misleading. Applied by Alchemist Remote Detonator (with a Marine Sphere Bottle) today; the PDF
    says it will be core to another class, so keep the profile constants as the single source.
12. **Archer / Hunter [3]** — ✅ done (Hunter Rework PDF, with-DEF). All correct, no code changes:
    the PS INT/DEX trap formulas were already implemented and match the PDF's comparison table exactly
    (Land Mine SkillLv×(JobLv+Dex)×(BaseLv+Int)/45, Blast Mine .../45 with Dex/Int roles swapped,
    Freezing Trap & Claymore Trap the same pattern /70 → for 99/50 DEX150/INT100: LandMine 4422,
    BlastMine 4150, FreezingTrap 2842, Claymore 2667). Traps correctly bypass DEF and auto-hit
    (IgnoreDefense/IgnoreFlee). Card bonuses verified applying via bSkillAtk: Dory (+5% Freezing/
    Claymore), Wolpertinger (+5% Land/Blast), Setting Dirk (+5% all four traps). Vulture's Eye
    contributes its +Hit as expected.
13. **Bard / Clown [2]** — ✅ done (PS wiki + in-game skill DB, with-DEF). Fixed **Arrow Vulcan**
    (CG_ARROWVULCAN): it had no ratio in any table and fell back to a flat 100% at every level; now
    `200 + 100×lv` → Lv1 300% … Lv10 1200% (matches vanilla and the PS in-game description; PS did
    not rework it — added to weapon_vanilla_ok). Musical Strike already correct via PS override
    (175+25×lv → Lv1 200%, Lv5 300%). Musical Lesson passive gives +5 ATK/lv as configured. The
    wiki's "+100% while performing" Musical Strike bonus is now modeled via a **Performing**
    target-panel toggle (skill_params.PS_PERFORMING_active → +100 ratio points on Musical Strike /
    Throw Arrow only). Arrow element for these arrow-consuming skills already flows through the
    equipped arrow's `bonus bAtkEle` script (verified: Fire→Earth 1.5, Holy→Shadow 1.25, etc.).
14. **Dancer / Gypsy [2]** — ✅ done (PS wiki, with-DEF). All correct, no code changes: **Throw
    Arrow** (DC_THROWARROW) already carries the PS override `175+25×lv` → Lv1 200%, Lv5 300%
    (the Dancer mirror of Musical Strike, verified live). **Arrow Vulcan** (shared with Gypsy) was
    fixed in item 13 and verified here too (Lv10 1200%). Dancing Lesson passive gives +5 ATK/lv
    and +10% crit at Lv10 as configured. The "+100% while performing" bonus applies here too via
    the same Performing toggle (item 13).
15. **Super Novice [23]** — ✅ done (wiki.payonstories.com/Super_Novice, 2026-07-16 audit).
    **Equipment**: the Hercules item DB has no SN job bit — the game equips SN via the Novice
    base-class mask, so all job filters map 23 → 0 (fixed; SN-only gear like the Super Novice Hat
    is EquipLv-gated instead). The **Angel's Protection Set** 5-piece combo (Kiss_Of_Angel +
    Angels_Protection/Warmth/Arrival/Safeguard → MaxHP +900, MaxSP +100) was already in the vanilla
    combo DB and matches the PS item API exactly; piece scripts verified. **Skill tree** (57 skills =
    all six 1st-class trees, no bow skills) matches; the damage picker is job-agnostic so Bash /
    Magnum / Mammonite / Envenom / bolts / Heal-bomb all work with their audited ratios. **Job
    bonuses** (+5 all stats by JL68, breakpoints STR@49/AGI@52/VIT@56/INT@60/DEX@64/LUK@68) match the
    wiki; JL cap 99. **HP/SP**: base = Novice table (Hercules `Inherit: Novice`) + the PS staged
    bonuses (L40+100 … L99+1000 = +2400 HP; +10 SP per 10 levels from 20 + 30@99 = +110 SP) — already
    modeled via `sn_hp_bonus`/`sn_sp_bonus`. **Added this audit**: SN **Fury chant** toggle
    (grants Explosion Spirits at Lv 13 → PS formula 175+25×13 = +50% crit, matching the wiki's
    "critical rate +50"; same formula as the Monk's cast), **Attention Concentrate** made
    available to SN (AC_CONCENTRATION is in its tree), and the **never-died** toggle (job 70+ without
    dying → +10 all stats, `flags.sn_never_died`). **Deferred**: Mental Strength (post-99 Steel Body
    at 0 HP after 99,999,999 exp — survivability-only, needs a Steel Body toggle that Monks don't
    have either); Guardian Angel level-up buffs (one-shot Kyrie/Magnificat/Gloria/Suffragium/
    Impositio — obtainable via the existing Priest support-buff toggles); Soul Harvest (no damage
    surface).

Cross-cutting PS mechanics to keep in view while auditing any class: `PS_BLEEDING_REVAMP`,
`PS_GRANDCROSS_MASTERY_APPLIES`, `SC_AMPLIFYMAGICPOWER_SCALING`, `PS_CRIT_SHIELD_DISABLED`, and the
`SC_TWOHANDQUICKEN` / `SC_SPEARQUICKEN` / `SC_EXPLOSIONSPIRITS` reworks.

### Transcendent / niche combat skills still unmodeled (deferred — 2026-07-10 sweep)

These surfaced in the 2026-07-10 full exposed-skill sweep. They currently fall through to a **flat
100% ratio** (no entry in any ratio table) or need a dedicated branch, and were **not** part of the
per-class audit above (that pass targeted PS-*reworked* 2nd-class skills). No PS wiki pages exist for
them, so the formulas below are **vanilla pre-re** (PR-Hercules `battle.c`) and should be confirmed
against in-game PS behavior before implementing. The user confirmed these classes *are* usable on PS.

Simple ratios (add to `PS_BF_WEAPON_RATIOS` / `BF_WEAPON_RATIOS`; the value is the full % incl. the
100 base):

- **CH_TIGERFIST** (Tiger Knuckle Fist): `40 + 100×lv`. battle.c:2073 (`100×lv − 60`).
- **CH_CHAINCRUSH** (Chain Crush Combo): `400 + 100×lv`. battle.c:2076 (`300 + 100×lv`).
- **CH_PALMSTRIKE** (Raging Palm Strike): `200 + 100×lv`. battle.c:2079 (`100 + 100×lv`).
- **LK_HEADCRUSH** (Head Crush): `100 + 40×lv`. battle.c:2082.
- **LK_JOINTBEAT** (Joint Beat): `50 + 10×lv` base, **×2** with the Break-Neck ailment. battle.c:2085.
- **SN_SHARPSHOOTING** (Sharp Shooting): `200 + 50×lv`; also **auto-critical** (`cri += 200`) and a
  splash skill. battle.c:2094.

Special mechanics (need a dedicated branch, not a plain ratio):

- **PA_PRESSURE** (Gloria Domini): **fixed** damage `500 + 300×lv`, ignores ATK/DEF/element entirely
  (BF_MISC). battle.c:3951.
- **PA_SACRIFICE** (Martyr's Reckoning): **%-of-caster-max-HP** per hit, self-damaging — not an ATK
  ratio. battle.c:2115 / 3948.
- **PA_SHIELDCHAIN** (Shield Chain): shield-weight base + `100 + 30×lv`% ratio; needs shield
  weight/refine inputs. battle.c:2118.
- **LK_SPIRALPIERCE** (Spiral Pierce): weapon-weight × target-size, fixed **5 hits** (pre-re; the
  renewal `50×lv` ratio is `#ifdef RENEWAL` only). battle.c:4834 / 5050.
- **HW_MAGICCRASHER** (Stave Crasher): weapon hit whose base substitutes **MATK** for weapon ATK,
  100% ratio, single hit, pierces MDEF. battle.c:3610 (`flag&4` / `flag.imdef=2`).
- **KN_CHARGEATK** (Charge Attack): distance-tiered **100 / 200 / 300%** (+100% per 3 cells, cap
  300%); needs a distance input. battle.c:2200.

Also drop **HT_POWER** from the picker — it's not a real PS player skill (internal Hercules ID,
`−50 + 8×STR`), not a damage skill to model.

## Suggested order for finishing the port

1. ~~Fill in the rest of `skill_ratio.js`'s `BF_WEAPON_RATIOS` table~~ — done, see above.
2. ~~Port `incoming_physical_pipeline.js` / `incoming_magic_pipeline.js`~~ — done, see above. ~~Still needed: frontend UI for it.~~ Frontend UI shipped (Survivability panel).
3. ~~Flesh out `PAYON_STORIES` in `serverProfiles.js`~~ — partially done (see
   "Partially ported" above: weapon/magic ratios + vanilla_ok + 4 mechanic
   flags); ~13 mechanic flags still need new modifier code, 3 PS-custom
   skills need a `getSkill()` data-source fix.
4. Remaining BF_MISC skills, then the remaining GUI sections (buffs,
   consumables, combat controls) as their own frontend panels.

## Non-damage clause coverage audit (2026-07-12)

**Why this exists.** The per-class audit above verifies *damage numbers* (ratio × DEF × cards ×
masteries). But many skills carry **non-damage clauses in their description** — accuracy/hit-rate
bonuses, auto-hit, crit enable/bonus, forced element, multi-hit count, ignore/reduce-DEF — that also
change the calculator's output (hit%, crit%, damage, DPS). Those were never a checklist item, so
gaps hid in plain sight (Holy Cross's documented +20% accuracy was in the data the whole time). This
section makes that category a standing punch-list.

**How to re-run the sweep.** Extract every PS player-skill description clause and bucket by whether it
touches calc output. A regex scan over `data/ps/ps_skill_db.json` descriptions for
`accuracy|hit rate|always hit|never miss|ignore (flee|def|mdef)|critical|hits (twice|N times)|forced?
element|reduces? def|size` (dropping NPC_/mercenary/homunc/3rd-job/guild prefixes) flags ~100 skills
across 9 categories. Cross-check each flagged clause against the engine and mark modeled/gap. Prefer
this **description-clause** pass over trusting `levels[].effect` (damage-only) fields.

### Fixed in this pass
- **CR_HOLYCROSS** — +20% accuracy bonus (`hitChance.js` `SKILL_HITRATE_PCT_BONUS`).
  **Corrected 2026-08-11:** it is **+2% of hitrate per rank** (2/4/…/20 at Lv1–10 —
  wiki.payonstories.com/Holy_Cross "Accuracy Bonus" column), not a flat 20% at every rank. The
  scraped one-line skill description only quotes the Lv10 value, which is what the flat read came
  from. Reported by a player (accuracy didn't move with Holy Cross rank).
- **PA_SHIELDCHAIN** — +20% accuracy bonus (same table; battle.c:4713 groups it with Holy Cross).
- **SN_SHARPSHOOTING / MA_SHARPSHOOTING** — +20 crit was DEAD: `critChance.js` hardcoded ids
  (280/357) never matched the loaded skills.json ids (382/8215). Re-keyed to skill **name**.
- **KN_PIERCE / ML_PIERCE** — hits by target size (Small 1 / Medium 2 / Large 3), was flat 3
  (battle.c:4395 `wd.div_ = size+1`). Added size-based `weapon_hit_counts` fns in `serverProfiles.js`.
- **The rest of the accuracy table** (2026-08-11, surfaced by the Holy Cross correction — only Holy
  Cross and Shield Chain were ever in `SKILL_HITRATE_PCT_BONUS`, so every other documented accuracy
  bonus was silently missing): **SM_BASH** +5%/lv, **SM_MAGNUM** +10%/lv, **KN_PIERCE** +5%/lv,
  **KN_AUTOCOUNTER** +20%, and **BS_WEAPONRESEARCH** +2%/lv — the last a *passive* that rides on
  every attack (battle.c:5355 "Weaponry Research hidden bonus"; the wiki lists +Accuracy% as a third
  column beside its +HIT and +ATK, both of which were already modeled). All confirmed on the PS wiki
  skill pages, all vanilla-parity values. Sources now SUM into one multiplier as battle.c does.

## Max-level audit (2026-08-11)

**Why.** Power-Thrust shipped in the buff picker at 10 ranks for a 5-rank skill, adding +50% to
every skill ratio instead of +25% (a player spotted Cart Revolution priced at 300% vs 275%). The
*range* of an input had never been audited — only formulas. This is that sweep, for every skill.

**Method.** For all 500+ non-3rd-job skills, compare what the loader SERVES (`_applySkillCap`)
against `ps_skill_db.json`'s scraped max and the vanilla DB, then evaluate every profile ratio fn
at its served max to catch out-of-range tables.

**Findings.** No skill whose level scales damage was mis-served, and no ratio/proc table breaks at
its max (0 of both). 33 skills disagreed with the scrape: 11 are deliberate profile overrides
(reworks the scrape can't see), 22 were unexamined.

**Fixed.** `_applySkillCap` now resolves **profile override > PS scrape > vanilla**, taking the
scrape's max only when it is backed by a matching per-level table — a record scraped without one
can hold a placeholder (Falcon Assault reads 1 there). That corrected 11 skills the picker served
at the vanilla count, including **Joint Beat 10 → 5**, **Free Cast / Advanced Book / Amplify
Magic Power / Watery Evasion 10 → 5**, **Double Casting and Cast Cancel 5 → 1**, and the Sage
element fields 5 → 3 — and it closed a split-brain where the passive picker already showed the PS
number while the skill picker showed vanilla's. Five more were settled from the live wiki infobox
("Levels: N") as explicit overrides: **Strip Weapon/Armor/Shield/Helm 5 → 3**, **Abracadabra
10 → 5**. `battlePipeline` now clamps a cast to the served max, not just to an explicit override,
so share URLs made under the old counts stop computing with ranks that don't exist.

**Still unresolved (4).** `SN_FALCONASSAULT` (scrape 1, no table, no wiki page — vanilla 5 kept),
`ST_FULLSTRIP` (scrape 3), `PF_FOGWALL` (scrape 1), `CR_ALCHEMY` (dead skill). None scale damage.
Re-check after any wiki update.

~~**Adjacent finding — LK_JOINTBEAT has no PS ratio**~~ — **fixed 2026-08-17.** It had no PS
entry, so it fell through to vanilla's `50 + 10×lv` (battle.c:2085) — 60% at Lv1 rising to only
**100% at Lv5**, and flagged "⚠ Vanilla fallback (PS unaudited)" in the breakdown. The bundled
scrape carries the real PS table: **40% per level** (40/80/120/160/200% at Lv1–5, its PS max),
now in `PS_BF_WEAPON_RATIOS` with the `lordknight-joint-beat-lv5` golden. So PS Lv5 is **double**
what the calc showed, while Lv1–2 were over-reported. The ×2 Break-Neck ailment multiplier stays
unmodeled — it needs the target to already carry that status.

### Open gaps (verified, prioritised) — punch-list
- **A test assertion that cannot fail: the PS-only guard on Throw Shuriken's Flee override.**
  From reviewing PR #2 (Mihtsuki), which is correct and worth merging — this is a follow-up on
  its test, not a reason to hold it. The test ends with:
  `assert.equal(rStd.hit_chance, 100, "STANDARD (vanilla) profile must still auto-hit")`,
  intended to prove `NJ_SYURIKEN_FLEE_IGNORE_DISABLED` stays scoped to Payon Stories.
  **It passes whether or not the override is gated.** On the `standard` profile there is no
  ratio for `NJ_SYURIKEN`, so the BF_MISC guard short-circuits to a canned "Not yet implemented"
  result — `hit_chance: 100`, `avg_damage: 0`, `dps_valid: false` — and that 100 is hardcoded,
  never consulting `nk_ignore_flee`. Demonstrated by sabotage: deleting the flag from the profile
  correctly fails the test, but making the override **unconditional** (dropping the
  `mechanic_flags.has(...)` check entirely, so it leaks into vanilla) leaves all 209 tests green.
  So the leak it is meant to catch is exactly the leak it misses.
  **Fix:** assert on `skill.nk_ignore_flee` directly after `calculate()`, or exercise a profile
  that actually models the skill. Same trap applies to any future "stays PS-only" assertion
  routed through `hit_chance` on a skill vanilla does not price — worth checking whether other
  tests lean on the same canned result.
- **Monk combo delay is missing its floor — we OVERSTATE Chain Combo / Combo Finish DPS.**
  `skillTiming.js` already applies the right idea to `MONK_COMBO_SKILLS`
  (`baseDelay -= 4*AGI + 2*DEX`), but the wiki's formula is
  **`max(800, (1000 - 4*agi - 2*dex + 300) + 25)`** — we are missing the `+300`, the `+25`
  and, critically, the **800 ms floor**. Measured on a Monk at AGI 97 / DEX 84: we compute
  **502 ms** where the wiki floors at **800 ms**, so combo DPS reads **~59% too high**.
  Note also that our DB base for `MO_COMBOFINISH` is **700 ms** while the wiki uses 1000 for
  both skills. Sources: wiki.payonstories.com/Chain_Combo and /Combo_Finish (both state the
  formula identically, in the `delay =` infobox field and again in the body).
  This is the one in the family that reads too STRONG, so it should go first.
- ~~**Stat-scaled after-cast delay is only wired to Monk — Assassin and Ninja skills miss it.**~~ — **implemented 2026-08-23** via `ps_skill_delay_fn` (see "Done this pass"). The Huuma and Throw Shuriken notes below remain OPEN.
  The same `X - (4*AGI + 2*DEX)` reduction the Monk combo path uses is documented on the wiki
  for several skills that never get it, so they all read too SLOW. Measured at AGI 96 / DEX 84:
  | skill | wiki delay | ours | effect |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `AS_SONICBLOW` | `2000 - (4*AGI + 2*DEX)` = 1424 ms | 2000 ms | DPS ~29% low |
  | `NJ_KUNAI` (Throw Kunai) | `1000 - (4*AGI + 2*DEX)` = 448 ms | 1000 ms | DPS ~55% low |
  | `NJ_KASUMIKIRI` (Haze Slasher) | `1000 - (4*AGI + 2*DEX)` = 448 ms | 1000 ms | DPS ~55% low |
  The extension point already exists and is empty: **`profile.ps_skill_delay_fn`** is read by
  `calculateSkillTiming` before the `MONK_COMBO_SKILLS` branch, so these drop in as per-skill
  functions without touching the Monk path. Sources: wiki.payonstories.com/Sonic_Blow
  ("delay = 2000 - (AGI*4 + DEX*2) ms"), /Throw_Kunai ("The delay is reduced based on the
  formula: 1000 - (4*AGI + 2*DEX) ms"), /Haze_Slasher ("The delay is reduced based on the
  formula: 4*AGI + 2*DEX").
  **Blocked on a decision — `NJ_HUUMA` (Throw Huuma Shuriken).** Same mechanic, doubled
  coefficients: the wiki gives cast `0.5 + 0.5*lv` (3 s at Lv5) and delay
  `2000 - (8*AGI + 4*DEX)` = 896 ms, but does **not** say whether that cast is DEX-reducible.
  We currently DEX-reduce the cast (3000 → 1320) and apply the full unreduced 2000 delay, for
  3320 ms. Cast-reducible reads 2216 ms (we are 1.5x slow); cast-fixed reads 3896 ms (we are
  15% fast). **Needs an in-game timing before picking a side** — do not guess this one.
  Related, found in the same investigation but a different kind of gap: **`NJ_SYURIKEN`
  (Throw Shuriken) is not modelled at all** — typed `Misc` with no ratio, so the BF_MISC guard
  returns 0 damage. Per the wiki it is a normal-attack-shaped skill (flat **+5xSkillLv ATK**,
  "inherits both the attack speed and the size penalties of the weapon class", range 9,
  consumes shuriken ammo, which we already carry as 13250-13254). Its PACING would already be
  correct once priced, because `skillPeriodMs` floors the period at the ASPD delay; the only
  blocker is the missing ratio. Throwing Mastery's +3xlv is already implemented and matches.
  **CORRECTION (2026-08-24): that pacing claim was WRONG, and the skill is now implemented —
  see "Done this pass".** The ASPD floor gives `adelay`, but Throw Shuriken runs on `amotion`,
  which is half of it. Trusting the floor would have shipped the skill at HALF speed.
- ~~**Gunslinger coins + Fling**~~ — **implemented 2026-08-21**, gated on `GS_FLING_PS_FORMULA`.
  Coins are now a build resource (`gs_coins`, 0–10, serialised under `flags` like `spirit_spheres`,
  Gunslinger-gated in the Buffs panel). Fling is BOTH halves, deliberately split: its **damage** is
  `_runFlingBranch` — `(jobLvl + baseLvl)` per coin, capped at the 5 the skill spends even though 10
  can be held — and its **DEF cut** is a target debuff (`target_mods.fling`, 0–5 coins,
  `def_percent -= 3 × coins`), because a Gunslinger in your party can Fling for everyone.
  `dps_valid: false`: coins are a finite pool, not a rate.
  Sources: wiki.payonstories.com/Fling (raw page, not a model summary — "Consumes up to 5 coins",
  "Reduces targets Hard Def by 3*coins used", "Does (jobLvl+baseLvl) dmg per coin used. This damage
  is not affected by Barrage, target defense or element", "Only reduces Soft Def against players")
  and wiki.payonstories.com/Flip_the_Coin ("Caster can have maximum 10 coins").
  **PS retuned the rate**: Hercules is 5%/coin (`status.c:8714`, `val2 = 5*val1`); PS is 3%.
  The DEF cut rides `def_percent`, the SAME field as Provoke, and that is load-bearing rather than
  lazy: Hercules applies def_percent to soft DEF only when the target is a player (`battle.c:1494`)
  but to hard AND soft for a monster (`1510-11`), so the wiki's "Only reduces Soft Def against
  players" falls out of the shared field with no special case. A test asserts `defenseFix` still
  branches on `is_pc`, since that note breaks silently if it stops.
  "Not affected by Barrage" is why the damage has its own branch instead of the normal chain:
  Barrage is the Gunslinger's +30% damage buff (`rate_bonuses.SC_GS_MADNESSCANCEL`) that every
  OTHER Gunslinger skill does get.
  **Boss behaviour — VERIFIED 2026-08-21, no longer an assumption: Fling DOES affect bosses.**
  Hercules gates boss status-immunity two independent ways and GS_FLING passes both. (1) An
  explicit per-skill guard: Provoke has one (`skill.c:7691`, `if ((tstatus->mode&MD_BOSS) || ...)
  return 1`), Fling's call site does not — `skill.c:2032` is a bare
  `sc_start(src, bl, SC_FLING, 100, ...)` inside `skill_additional_effect` with no mode check.
  (2) The generic `is_boss_resist_sc(type)` in `status_change_start`, which returns true only for
  common ailments or a status carrying the `NoBoss` flag from `db/pre-re/sc_config.conf`. That file
  gives SC_FLING no Flags block at all —
  `SC_FLING: { CalcFlags: { DefPerc: true }  Skill: "GS_FLING" }` — while SC_PROVOKE has
  `Flags: { Debuff: true  NoBoss: true }`. 40 statuses carry NoBoss in pre-re, so the absence is
  meaningful rather than an empty file. That entry independently confirms the field this uses:
  `DefPerc` IS `def_percent`.
- **The rest of the coin economy is documented but unmodelled** [low–med] — from the **Gunslinger
  Release Patch Notes PDF** (Downloads folder, Friekshow, 2025-03-01), the authoritative source for
  this class, which had not previously been read. Coin costs: **Barrage 2** (+20% ASPD, +30% DMG,
  20 s — replaces the Run and Gun buff), **Run and Gun 1** (+30% ranged resist, +30 FLEE, 1 min —
  replaces the Barrage buff; the two are mutually exclusive), **Soul Bullet 1**
  (`100 + DEX + BaseLvl` ×3, Ghost), **Tranq Shot 1** (100% ATK, ignores DEF, not affected by
  cards), **Disarm 1**. Coin Flip itself: `(2×lv)²` zeny for `2×lv` coins, 3 s cast reducible by
  DEX, `(2×lv)%` chance to cost no zeny.
  Barrage's +30% and Gatling Fever's +40% were ALREADY modelled (`rate_bonuses`).
  **Coin accounting added 2026-08-21** (frontend): the Buffs panel totals what a build is asking
  its pool to pay for — Barrage 2, Run and Gun 1, plus the selected skill (Soul Bullet / Tranq Shot
  / Disarm 1 each, Fling up to 5) — and says "Spending N of M" or "Needs N — X short" in `--crit`.
  Fling counts ONLY when it is the selected skill: the Fling entry under target debuffs is someone
  else's Gunslinger, whose coins are not yours. The engine still prices exactly what was asked for
  rather than silently shrinking Fling to what is affordable; the panel reports the shortfall
  instead. **Barrage and Run and Gun are now mutually exclusive** (each "replaces" the other per the
  PDF), enforced inside `updateBuffField` so it holds however the buff is set.
  Still unmodelled: `GS_BULLSEYE`'s bleed chance, which the PS description says differs "with
  coins".
- **Wildcard card mix for SHIELDS (racial resist)** [low, player-requested 2026-08-18] — the
  wildcard system covers the OFFENSIVE dicts (`add_race`/`add_size`/`add_ele`/`add_race2`, merged in
  `playerStateBuilder`). A shield wildcard wants the DEFENSIVE side (`sub_race`), a different dict on
  a different path. **Verify rather than assume it lands**: `bSubSize` turned out never to be
  aggregated at all (fixed 2026-08-17), so the defensive path has a track record of silently
  dropping bonuses — write the assertion first.
- **Incoming cardfix: two defender terms still unmodelled** [low] — `calculateCardFixMagic` now
  applies the full Hercules BF_MAGIC defender set (battle.c:1132-1156) when a caster is passed:
  `subele`, `subsize`, `subrace[race]`, `subrace[Boss/NonBoss]`, the LONG ranged rate (magic sets
  `ad.flag = BF_MAGIC|BF_SKILL` with neither BF_SHORT nor BF_LONG, so the `else` branch always
  wins — Skotlex's "ranged defense also counts vs magic"), and `magic_def_rate`. Not modelled:
  **`subrace2`** (RC2 family resists, e.g. an Orc-family card) and **`add_mdef`** (bAddMonsterDef
  per monster class), neither of which the gear aggregator collects. Also, the PvP path
  (`calculateCardFixMagic` with no caster) keeps the old Demi-Human-only behaviour: correct for the
  race term since a player caster IS Demi-Human, but it skips the size (players are Medium) and
  boss terms. Deliberate — passing a caster there would move PvP numbers with nobody having
  verified them.
- **Incoming damage rounds slightly high vs the client** [low, ~1 per reduction step] — Hercules
  accumulates every cardfix reduction into ONE integer per-mille factor (`cardfix`, starting 1000)
  and applies a single `damage * cardfix / 1000` at the end, whereas this engine `scaleFloor`s the
  pmf once per reduction, flooring at each step. With −5% size and −30% race on 13564: Hercules
  does `1000→950→665` then one multiply = 9020; we do `floor(13564×0.95)=12885` then
  `floor(12885×0.70)=9019`. Off by one here, and it compounds with the number of reductions — the
  likely source of a player-reported 10047-vs-10055 gap. Fixing it means accumulating a per-mille
  factor through `calculateCardFix*` and applying it once, which moves every incoming golden by a
  point or two, so it wants doing deliberately rather than as a drive-by.
- **Monster-cast 3rd-job skills: 4 still unpriced** [low–med] — `FLAT_UNMODELED_SKILLS` in
  `mobSkillRatios.js` holds `WL_CRIMSONROCK`, `RK_SONICWAVE`,
  `SO_CLOUD_KILL`, `LG_RAYOFGENESIS`. (`SC_MAELSTROM` left this list 2026-08-17 — it deals no
  damage at all, it converts cells to dead cells, so it is now in `NO_HP_DAMAGE_SKILLS`. NB
  `mob_skill_db.json`'s generator marks it `dmg:true` because its rule is "Magic|Weapon and
  targets a foe" and Maelstrom is Magic at `around1` — the classification is what corrects it.)
  No PS player can learn them, but monsters
  cast them, and their vanilla formulas are behind `#ifdef RENEWAL` — so on a pre-renewal server
  whatever they do is custom and undocumented (the wiki's monster pages list a skill's level and
  trigger rate but never a formula, and kokotewa returns "Unknown skill"). They show element and
  type only, deliberately. **`GC_DARKCROW` (Dark Claw) came off this list 2026-08-17** when the PS
  value was supplied directly: **100 × SkillLv per hit, over the skill's 3 hits** — so Twinorc's
  Lv2 cast is 3 × 200% = 600% of its ATK, at a 40% trigger rate. It lives in
  `PS_BF_WEAPON_RATIOS` rather than `MOB_SKILL_RATIOS` **on purpose**: the incoming path checks
  `profile.weapon_ratios` first and reports a hit there as PS-exact, while `MOB_SKILL_RATIOS`
  flags `estimated: true` (correct for a Hercules-baseline guess, wrong for a known PS value).
  The `GC_` prefix keeps it out of the player skill picker regardless.
  **`AB_ADORAMUS` and `WL_DRAINLIFE` came off the same day**, into `PS_BF_MAGIC_RATIOS` for the
  same reason: **Adoramus 1400% MATK** (Holy; its `number_of_hits` is −10, i.e. cosmetic, so the
  ratio is the whole skill and lands once) and **Drain Life 750% MATK** (Neutral; its HP drain is
  not modelled). **Both are FLAT and verified at exactly one level** — Lady Huo (mob 3049) is the
  sole caster of either, at Adoramus Lv10 and Drain Life Lv3. Per-level scaling is unknown and was
  deliberately NOT guessed (1400/10 and 750/3 both divide evenly, which is suggestive, not
  evidence). A test pins the caster-and-level set for both, so a `monsters.json` regeneration that
  adds a caster or shifts a level fails loudly rather than letting a flat constant quietly become
  a fabricated number at a level nobody verified.
  The remaining five unblock the same way — one measured/quoted PS formula each, not code.
- ~~**AM_SPHEREMINE (Sphere Mine)**~~ — **implemented 2026-08-17** (`_runSphereMineBranch`), gated on
  the `AM_SPHEREMINE_PS_FORMULA` flag. Player-requested in Discord alongside Acid Terror.
  `wiki.payonstories.com/Sphere_Mine`: **`1000 + 200 × SkillLv + 25 × Total VIT`**, Fire element,
  and its Notes are explicit that it "ignores DEF" and is "not affected by weapon size penalties"
  (the old formula was `2000 + 400×SkillLv`; the Marine Sphere Bottle cost was removed; cooldown
  0.5 s, now in `ps_skill_cooldowns.json`). Fixed damage — no weapon roll, no crit. Dispatched
  ABOVE the NoDamage guard and given an explicit picker exemption in `routes/data.ts`, because the
  vanilla DB types it "Place"/NoDamage with a null `attack_type`. **Assumption:** attacker card
  bonuses are not applied (the wiki enumerates DEF and size and is silent on cards; this is
  summon-detonation damage, i.e. the BF_MISC family — see the entry above). `bSkillAtk` IS applied,
  the one attacker term `battle_calc_misc_attack` honours.
  **NB the wiki's "The summoned Marine Sphere is Water 3 property" is the SPHERE's own defence**
  (it is why a Demonstration can launch spheres without damaging them), NOT the element of the
  explosion, which the same Notes state is Fire. Don't "fix" this to Water.
  **Process lesson — the one that cost the most here:** this was first written up as *blocked on
  data*, on the strength of `ps_skill_db.json` describing a pre-rework "custom HP formula" with
  damage equal to the sphere's remaining HP, plus the Alchemist rework PDF not mentioning the skill
  at all. Both are true and both are stale. **The bundled scrape cannot see a post-scrape rework —
  fetch the live wiki page before calling any PS formula undocumented.** Vanilla was a red herring
  too: there the sphere really is mob 1142 detonating via `NPC_SELFDESTRUCTION` for `sstatus->hp`
  (battle.c:4467), a mechanic PS deleted outright.
- **BF_MISC takes NO attacker card bonuses — traps still do** [med]. Established while chasing a
  player-reported DPS gap against the jaludev calc. `battle_calc_misc_attack` (battle.c:4341) never
  calls `battle_calc_defense`, and `battle_calc_cardfix`'s `case BF_MISC` (battle.c:1354) has ONLY a
  `tsd` (defender) block — unlike `case BF_WEAPON` it has no attacker-side `sd` branch at all, so
  `right_weapon.addrace[...]` never reaches Misc damage. In PvE `tsd` is NULL, making the whole call
  a no-op; `battle_calc_cardfix2` is `#ifdef RENEWAL`, dead pre-re. **Fixed for the falcon**
  (`falconCalc.js`, 2026-08-17 — it was doubling on 4× Abysmal Knight vs a boss). **Still wrong for
  the traps**: `HT_BLASTMINE` / `HT_LANDMINE` / `HT_CLAYMORETRAP` are the same BF_MISC family (they
  sit in that same Hercules function) but route through `_runBranch`, which runs `cardFix` — measured
  Blast Mine Lv5 vs Phreeoni at **1051 bare → 2102 with 4× Abysmal Knight, exactly 2.00×**. They
  correctly skip Defense Fix already. Fixing them means bypassing `cardFix` for Misc-typed skills
  rather than special-casing each trap.
  Two attacker-side terms that ARE legitimate on BF_MISC and are unmodelled: `pc->skillatk_bonus`
  (`bonus2 bSkillAtk,<skill>,<pct>`, battle.c:4395 — no PS item grants it for these skills today,
  but it is the correct hook if one appears), and `NK_SPLASHSPLIT`, which an **autocast** Blitz Beat
  sets when it hits more than one target (damage divided among them) — so auto-blitz is overstated
  against a pack, though single-target is right.
- **Auto Blitz Beat proc chance — sources disagree** [low, ~180 DPS]. Ours and the PS wiki say
  `⌊LUK/3⌋` ("for every 3 points of LUK there is an additional 1% chance") = 38% at LUK 114;
  Hercules `skill.c:1638` is `rnd()%1000 <= luk*3`, i.e. `(3×LUK+1)/1000` = 34.3%; the jaludev calc
  uses `1 + 0.3×LUK` = 35.2%. Left on the wiki reading per the source hierarchy (wiki beats battle.c
  for PS-reworked skills, and Blitz Beat's damage formula IS PS-reworked). Recorded, not silently
  overridden. NB ours is right where jaludev is wrong on the same skill: hit count is
  `min(BlitzLv, job_level/10 + 1, 5)`, matching both Hercules and the wiki's "job level 40+ can reach
  the full 5 hits"; jaludev's `⌊(JobLV−1)/10⌋+1` gives 4 at job level 40.
- **`bAutoSpellWhenHit` has no consumer at all** [med] — 42 distinct skills across ~90 items
  (Dark Lord Card's Meteor Storm, Ifrit Card's Earthquake, Ring of Resonance's Venom Splasher,
  and a long tail of defensive Heal/Assumptio/Kyrie). `gearBonuses.autocast_when_hit` is
  populated and then read by nobody. The offensive ones are real damage a tank deals, but they
  fire on the MONSTER's attack rate, not yours — so like Reflect Shield they belong in the
  Survivability panel as damage-per-hit-taken (`dps_valid:false`), not in your DPS. The
  defensive ones (auto-Heal, auto-Assumptio) would be a survivability term. Needs the incoming
  pipeline to grow a proc concept; scoped out for now, but it is the single biggest remaining
  proc category.
- **On-ATTACK autocasts still fire only on auto-attacks** [low] — in-game `bonus3 bAutoSpell`
  triggers off skill hits too. Deliberate: pricing a proc off a skill needs the proc's own
  attack-period model. (`bAutoSpellOnSkill` is exempt and IS priced — it names its trigger, so
  the trigger's period is the period. Implemented 2026-08-11 for both the physical and magic
  paths: Elemental Sword's bolt chain, Dagger of Hunter's Bash, Nepenthes Bow, Croce Staff,
  Horn of Hillslion, Holy Marcher Hat.)
- **`bHolyStrikeChance` (Ancient Mummy + Mummy card combo) is parsed and dropped** [low] — the
  field `holy_strike_bonus_chance` exists on the gear bonuses and nothing reads it, because
  PS_PR_HOLYSTRIKE itself is unsurfaced (see the Rogue/Stalker audit note above: its job array
  is [7, 4008]). Fix the passive first, then the combo's +5% has somewhere to go.
- ~~**PS_CORRUPTINGDRAIN (Corruptor Card)**~~ — **modelled 2026-08-11.** The in-game card tooltip
  carries the formula the API's description omits:
  `100 + STR + ⌊STR²/40⌋ + DEX + ⌊DEX²/40⌋ + INT + ⌊INT²/40⌋ + LUK + ⌊LUK²/40⌋`, off TOTAL stats,
  healing 75% of what it deals. Lives in `PAYON_STORIES.misc_formulas` (that field's first
  consumer) and is priced by `_runMiscFormulaBranch` — fixed damage, no weapon roll, no
  element/size/race, one breakdown step per stat. Rate is 4% melee / 2% ranged from the
  ATF_SHORT/ATF_LONG flags, and it now counts toward the DPS. **Assumption to verify:** the card
  documents no DEF interaction, so none is applied — if in-game numbers show DEF biting, add a
  `defenseFix` pass to the branch. The heal is reported as its own figure, never as damage.
  **General lesson: the in-game tooltip carries terms the item API's description drops** — the
  same trap as the pre/post-patch API lag noted in `context.md`.
- ~~**NJ_KIRIKAGE (Shadow Slash) crit**~~ — resolved 2026-08-27, after a player reported a crit
  Shadow Slash build the calculator could not represent. Shadow's Within is now a toggle
  (`support_buffs.shadows_within`, bridged in `calculate.ts` beside `ninja_hiding`, checkbox in the
  Skill panel). On PS it is the whole gate: `isCritEligible` returns false for NJ_KIRIKAGE without
  it, matching "Shadow Slash no longer possesses the capability to land critical strikes… when
  paired with Shadow's Within, critical hits become a possibility". The bonus it carries is
  **+30/35/40/45/50 crit rate** by skill level, in `critChance.js`.
  **The bug worth remembering:** that bonus was already implemented — as `25 + 5*lv` added to the
  DAMAGE ratio in `serverProfiles.js`. `25 + 5*lv` is 30/35/40/45/50, i.e. the wiki table's
  "+Crit (%)" column filed as damage. It was also unreachable: `PS_NJ_SHADOWSWITHIN_active` had no
  producer anywhere, so the code had never once run. Source conflict recorded, not resolved: the
  per-level table scales 30→50 while the Shadow's Within page and skill DB both say a flat +50%;
  they agree at Lv5. Paired goldens (`ninja-shadow-slash-hiding` / `-shadows-within`) pin both
  states and assert non-crit damage is identical across them.
- ~~**AS_SONICACCEL**~~ — resolved 2026-08-11. wiki.payonstories.com/Sonic_Acceleration settles the
  conflict explicitly ("Sonic Acceleration does **not** give a flat +50 Hit … SA gives +50% 'Hit',
  the Hit actually being Accuracy rate", with a 30% → 45% worked example), i.e. battle.c's +50
  hitpercbonus, not the skill DB's "+50 Hit" wording. Implemented in `hitChance.js`; assumed learned,
  like the +10% damage half in `skillRatio.js`, and both are switched off by the same
  `skill_params.AS_SONICBLOW_sonic_accel`.
- **SN_SIGHT (True Sight)** [med, Snipers] — entire self-buff unmodeled: +5 all stats, accuracy,
  +weapon damage %, +crit. Not currently a selectable buff.
- **LK_CONCENTRATION** [med] — only the AGI/DEX% is applied (`statusCalculator.js:62`). Vanilla also
  grants a flat +HIT and an ATK% bonus (the self −DEF is out of scope for outgoing damage). Verify PS
  values before adding.
- **LK_SPIRALPIERCE** [med] — ignore-DEF/soft-DEF works via the `IgnoreDefense` flag, but the
  weapon-weight formula, the inverse size modifier (S 125 / M 100 / L 75%), and the "5 hits, damage
  divided evenly" model are unported → currently computes `100% × 5`. (See BF_MISC list above.)
- **PA_PRESSURE** [med] — fixed level-based damage that ignores DEF and ATK; currently runs through
  the ordinary DEF-reduced weapon-ratio branch. Needs a fixed-damage branch.
- **SL_SMA (Esma)** [low, Soul Linker] — element is `Ele_Endowed` (Warm Wind), absent from
  `ELE_STR_TO_INT`, so the magic branch stays Neutral; Warm Wind endow isn't threaded in.
- **Timing** [low–med, DPS only] — SC_BERSERK +30% ASPD (LK_BERSERK / MS_BERSERK) unmodeled;
  NJ_ZENYNAGE after-cast delay is 5s in the DB vs 2s described; MO_KITRANSLATION / MO_FINGEROFFENSIVE
  / Asura hard-cast PS reworks and the combo-ready instant-cast are unmodeled; SG_STAR_COMFORT /
  SG_DEVIL / SL_CRUSADER ASPD/delay buffs have no consumer.
- **Niche** [low] — AS_CLOAKING attack-from-cloak crit-double; SG_FUSION never-miss + ignore-DEF
  buff; HW_GRAVITATION DEF-ignoring damage (currently NoDamage, pending BF_MISC port); LK_AURABLADE
  flat DEF-ignoring/accuracy-independent damage add; PF_SPIDERWEB Fire ×2.5 vs webbed target.

### Confirmed correct (no action — recorded so they aren't re-flagged)
- **`if(!...)` used to FAIL OPEN — fixed 2026-08-21, worth knowing about.** `safeEvalInt`
  normalises `&&`/`||` to `and`/`or`, and `evalConditionals` treats a null result as TRUE so an
  unparseable condition still applies its bonus. But the tokenizer only ever emitted `!=`, never a
  bare `!` — so every `if(!...)` threw, returned null, and applied the very effect it was written to
  suppress. `!` is now normalised to the word `not`, which the existing `notExpr` already handled.
  Found via Wanderer Card (4210), whose
  `if(!isequipped(4172,4257,4230,4272)) bonus3 bAutoSpell,RG_INTIMIDATE,1,20;` kept proccing with
  the full thief set on. `isequipped(...)` was also unimplemented — now substituted to 1/0 from
  `ctx.equipped_ids`, a Set of every worn id (cards included) built once per `compute()` so a set
  bonus sees the whole outfit. With no list supplied it resolves to 0.
  Only ONE bundled item uses either construct, so the blast radius was tiny — but both were silent
  failures that applied bonuses rather than dropping them, which is the dangerous direction.
  **Debugging note**: the first attempt at the `isequipped` regex silently never matched because a
  Python heredoc wrote `\b` as a literal backspace byte (0x08) into the JS source. `cat -A` showed
  it as `^H`. If a regex written through a script inexplicably fails to match, check for control
  characters before doubting the logic.
- **Arrow ATK follows the SKILL's ammo requirement, not the weapon type** — FIXED 2026-08-21.
  A player reported "if you add oridecon arrows, it adds damage to acid terror" and was right; an
  earlier pass in this same session recorded the opposite and had to be reversed. Worth reading as
  a cautionary tale about stopping at the first plausible code path.
  The wrong reasoning was: `sd->state.arrow_atk = (weapontype == W_BOW || <guns>)` (battle.c:6852)
  → `flag.arrow` (4890) → the arrow roll (661), therefore any bow user's weapon skills get arrow
  ATK. Every line of that is real. **What it misses is that battle.c:6852 lives inside
  `battle_weapon_attack` — the NORMAL-ATTACK path.** When a skill is cast,
  `skill_check_condition_castbegin` OVERWRITES the same field from the skill's own requirement
  (skill.c:15810):
      require = skill->get_requirement(sd, skill_id, skill_lv);
      sd->state.arrow_atk = require.ammo ? 1 : 0;   // "Can only update state when weapon/arrow info is checked."
  So the rule is: **normal attack → weapon type; skill → that skill's ammo requirement.**
  `AC_DOUBLE` declares `AmmoTypes: { A_ARROW: true }, AmmoAmount: 1`; `AM_ACIDTERROR` declares only
  `Items: { Acid_Bottle: 1 }`. A bow Rogue's plagiarised Acid Terror therefore gains nothing from
  an Oridecon Arrow, and the engine was adding its full 50 ATK.
  Implemented from data — our `skills.json` already carries `requirements.ammo_types` /
  `ammo_amount`, so no new data was needed. **`HT_PHANTASMIC` is the one exception**: a Bows skill
  with no ammo requirement that Hercules force-sets anyway (battle.c:4909, "Since these do not
  consume ammo, they need to be explicitly set as arrow attacks"), so it is hardcoded. Every other
  ammo-using skill in the DB declares its requirement — verified across AC_DOUBLE/AC_SHOWER/
  AC_CHARGEARROW/SN_SHARPSHOOTING/BA_MUSICALSTRIKE/DC_THROWARROW/CG_ARROWVULCAN and the GS/NJ sets.
  No golden moved when the fix landed, because no scenario had a bow user casting a non-ammo skill
  — which is exactly why this survived. `bow-rogue-acid-terror-ignores-arrow` now covers it, with
  ammo deliberately equipped so the scenario fails if the bonus returns.
  **Still true from that investigation, and separately verified**: the arrow's ELEMENT never leaked
  (PS: "always neutral element" — a Fire Arrow build reads 474 vs Ghost 1 against 1899 vs Water 1,
  i.e. quartered, which is Neutral). And the wiki's "benefits from weapon ATK" is about the WEAPON,
  not its ammo.
  **Conflict worth knowing**: wiki.payonstories.com/Acid_Terror still lists 180/260/340/420/500%,
  the PRE-rework table, while the 2026-08-09 Alchemist PDF says "increased from 500% to 600% at max
  level, NEW FORMULA (100+100*SkillLv)%" — which is what the engine implements (200–600%). The wiki
  page is stale for this skill; do not "fix" the ratio to match it.
- **TK_COUNTER** "always hit" — modeled via `damage_type:["IgnoreFlee"]` in skills.json.
- Cosmetic multi-hit convention (negative `number_of_hits`): CR_HOLYCROSS −2, WZ_VERMILION −10,
  AS_SONICBLOW −8, TK_COUNTER −3 — damage applied once, correct.
- Forced elements for traps (Land/Blast/Claymore), GS_MAGICALBULLET (Ghost), the Ninja/Wizard bolts,
  and Grand Cross/Holy Cross (Holy) all resolve correctly; TF_POISON intentionally reverts to weapon
  element on PS (`TF_POISON_USES_WEAPON_ELEMENT`).
- DEF-reduction debuffs (Signum Crucis, Strip Shield/Armor, Mind Breaker, Eternal Chaos, Steel
  Body, Stone Curse) are representable via `target_active_scs` and consumed by `defenseFix.js` — they
  apply when the caller injects the matching status. (Minor: the *vanilla* Strip Armor branch models
  the MDEF cut as a VIT cut; the PS branch is correct.)
  **CORRECTION (2026-08-18): Fling was listed here and does NOT belong.** `defenseFix.js` reads only
  `SC_STONE`, `SC_FREEZE` and `SC_ETERNALCHAOS` — nothing consumes `SC_FLING`, and the UI never
  offered it, so a player asking for Fling was right that it is simply absent. It is also
  coin-driven, which the calculator has no concept of: wiki.payonstories.com/Fling — Lv1 only,
  consumes coins, "Reduces targets Hard Def by 3*coins used" (3% per coin, 15% at 5), 20 s, and
  deals `(jobLvl + baseLvl)` damage per coin, unaffected by Barrage, target defence or element;
  against players it cuts Soft DEF only. So Fling and the missing Gunslinger coin resource are ONE
  piece of work, not two — see the punch-list.

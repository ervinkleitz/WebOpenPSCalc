/**
 * protected-values.test.js — pins the handful of values that must not drift.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: most of this repo is safe to change freely, and should be. A few
 * values are different in kind — they decide where money goes, who the site claims
 * to be, and who it credits. Those are exactly the things that can be altered in a
 * one-line diff, look harmless in review, and do real damage if they land.
 *
 * The Ko-fi page id is the sharpest example. Swap those eight characters and every
 * donation the calculator earns goes to someone else, with nothing on screen looking
 * any different. A reviewer skimming a large PR will not catch that. This test will.
 *
 * These are NOT frozen forever. Changing one is a normal thing to do — you just have
 * to do it HERE as well, in the same commit, which turns a silent edit into a visible
 * one that a reviewer is asked to confirm on purpose. That is the whole mechanism:
 * not prevention, but forcing the change to announce itself.
 *
 * If a test here fails and you did not mean to touch these, you have found something.
 *
 * The payment-link sweep is deliberately blunt: it trips on the mere mention of a
 * payment host anywhere under src/, comments included. That is the right trade for
 * this one category — a false alarm costs a sentence in review, a missed one costs
 * every donation until somebody notices.

// Elemental Change keeps the monster's element LEVEL

// looks obviously right. wiki.payonstories.com/Elemental_Change says: "The element

// change will change a target to Water 1."
//
// We followed that until 2026-09-02, when a player reported the in-game damage being
// far higher than the calculator's and named the cause: the level carries over. On a
// Lunatic (Neutral 3) with a Water endow it is the difference between Fire 1 (x1.50)
// and Fire 3 (x2.00) — a third of the damage.
//
// Three things back the player over the page: the wiki had already proven stale that
// same week on Sidewinder Card ("adds 7%" against the item's actual Level 2); nothing
// else in that function touches element_level, with Frozen and Stone both swapping the
// element and leaving the level alone; and a monster's own NPC_CHANGE* element buffs
// are modelled the same way in targetSelfBuffs.js. Forcing 1 was the odd one out.

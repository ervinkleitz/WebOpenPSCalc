/**
 * server-traces.test.js — compare our pipeline against real SERVER output, stage by stage.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it is not the golden suite:
 *
 * goldens.json records what this engine produced last time. It proves we have not
 * changed; it can never prove we are right, because it is generated from the very
 * code it checks. Every wrong number this project has shipped was, at the time, a
 * perfectly green golden.
 *
 * Worse, a golden only pins the FINAL number. The first trace here is the argument
 * for this file: when it was recorded our total sat within 4.5% of the server's while
 * the intermediate stages were ~46% apart in opposite directions — an inflated base
 * damage cancelling a multiplier we do not model at all. A final-number check sails
 * straight through that, and did, until a player noticed their damage was wrong.
 *
 * That is no longer a hypothetical: fixing the base (the ranged min-ATK scaling now
 * needs an ammo-firing attack, 2026-08-28) moved every stage from +46% to +15% and
 * turned the "close" final number into -17.6%, exposing the multiplier that had been
 * hiding behind it. The stage view is what made that legible.
 *
 * So: stage-level, against numbers the SERVER produced.
 *
 * Reading a failure:
 *   - a "match" stage drifted        -> we broke something that was right
 *   - a pinned value moved           -> our behaviour changed; re-check the trace
 *   - a "diverges" stage now MATCHES -> good news, flip it to "match" in the fixture
 *
 * A known-divergent stage is NOT an excuse. It is pinned to its current wrong value
 * so the gap stays visible and any further drift still fails. Do not delete stages
 * to get green; fix the engine or record why you cannot.

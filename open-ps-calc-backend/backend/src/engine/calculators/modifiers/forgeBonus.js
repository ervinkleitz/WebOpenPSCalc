/**
 * Spirit-ball ATK bonus — Monk spheres AND Gunslinger coins. PS wiki: each grants +3 ATK
 * "similar to forged weapons imbued with Star Crumb" — a flat, per-hit add that
 * ignores enemy DEF & flee, is affected by cards but not elements. So it's applied
 * at the same pipeline position as the Star Crumb forge bonus (after AttrFix/DEF,
 * before CardFix), NOT folded into base ATK (which would wrongly scale it by the
 * skill ratio and, on Asura, by ×(8+SP/10)). Vanilla Hercules applies it as
 * ATK_ADD(div * spiritball * 3) right next to the Star Crumb add (battle.c:5439-5441).
 * `div` is the skill's hit count (Finger Offensive throws N ⇒ div=N; most skills div=1).
 *
 * GUNSLINGER COINS COUNT TOO, and this is checked against source rather than assumed:
 *   - `skill.c` `case GS_GLITTERING:` (Flip the Coin) calls
 *     `pc->addspiritball(sd, ..., 10)` — coins ARE `sd->spiritball`, and that 10 is
 *     where the coin cap comes from.
 *   - `battle.c` `ATK_ADD(wd.div_ * sd->spiritball * 3)`, inside `#ifndef RENEWAL`
 *     (PS is pre-renewal), sits immediately beside the Star Crumb `ATK_ADD2` and
 *     immediately before `battle->calc_cardfix`. That single line is the authority for
 *     all four properties: +3 each, MULTIPLIED BY THE HIT COUNT, at the Star Crumb
 *     position (so past DEF), and affected by cards. It carries no job check.
 * PS keeps it: the wiki's Gunslinger page says "Each coin adds +3 dmg to your attacks",
 * and the Flip Coin page notes coins are "similar to monk spirits". (The Monk side is
 * separately spelled out on Call Spirits: "+3 ATK that ignores enemy defense and flee",
 * "affected by cards but not by elements" — which is the same behaviour.)
 * The bonus used to be gated to the Monk line, so a Gunslinger's coins did nothing at
 * all: holding 10 was worth +30 ATK per hit and the calculator showed no change.
 * Reported by a player.

// Spheres are not Monk-only. Two routes put them on any other class, both reported by
// a player and both confirmed against Payon Stories' own pages:
//
//   Ki Translation — "Transfers one of your existing Spirit Spheres to a neutral or
//   friendly player. The recipient cannot have more than 5 spheres at a time...
//   Gunslingers cannot be bestowed upon." (wiki.payonstories.com/Ki_Translation)
//
//   Greatest General Card — "Add the chance of gaining Spirit Sphere or Coin when doing
//   Physical Attack", i.e. `bonus3 bAutoSpell,MO_CALLSPIRITS,5,...` on a hit. Call
//   Spirits Lv5, so it tops out at the same 5.
//
// Hence the 5 cap off the Monk line, and hence Gunslingers being excluded rather than
// merely capped: they cannot receive spheres at all, and coins are their equivalent —
// the card's own text gives them a coin where it would give anyone else a sphere.

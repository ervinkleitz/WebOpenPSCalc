/**
 * serverProfiles.js — JS port of core/server_profiles.py
 *
 * ServerProfile holds all server-specific deviations from vanilla Hercules,
 * as override dicts keyed by skill/SC name. An empty dict means vanilla
 * behaviour applies for all keys not present — every modifier in this engine
 * checks `profile.someDict[key]` first and falls back to a vanilla constant,
 * so an incomplete profile degrades gracefully rather than crashing.
 *
 * NOT FULLY PORTED: the original PAYON_STORIES profile populates several
 * hundred lines of per-skill weapon_ratios / magic_ratios / mastery overrides
 * that were not all transcribed here (the upstream file is ~1000 lines of
 * dense, skill-specific tuning). What IS ported below: the full ServerProfile
 * shape, the complete STANDARD (vanilla) profile, and the PS deviations that
 * were directly verified from source during this port (passive resists,
 * per-job stat bonuses, ASPD quicken overrides, proc rate overrides, the
 * SC_STEELBODY DEF/MDEF formula, and the Super Novice HP/SP bonus tables).
 * Skills without an explicit PS override fall back to vanilla ratios in
 * skillRatio.js, which is the same fallback behaviour the original code uses
 * for unaudited skills (it just also emits a warning step in that case).
